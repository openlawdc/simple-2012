The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on December 7, 2010, and December 21, 2010, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on January 12, 2011, it was assigned Act No. 18-687 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 18- 342 became effective on March 31, 2011.

Miscellaneous Notes

Section 4 of D.C. Law 18-342 provides:

"Sec. 4. Applicability.

"This act shall apply upon the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan."

The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of February 15, 2012, that the fiscal effect of Law 18-342 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 18-342, are not in effect.
