The proceeds shall be applied towards the delinquent PILOT, including interest and penalties thereon; provided, that the proceeds from the sale shall be applied first toward any delinquent water and sewer charges, and then toward any delinquent litter control nuisance fines, in accordance, respectively with §<a href='./34-2407.02.html'>§ 34-2407.02</a> and 34-2110, and <a href='./8-807.html'>§ 8-807</a>).
