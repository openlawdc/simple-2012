                <dt>a</dt>
                <dd> The judges of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia shall have the authority to appoint some official of the Metropolitan Police Department to act as a clerk of the court with authority to take bail or collateral from persons charged with offenses triable in the Superior Court at all times when the court is not open and its clerks accessible. The official so appointed shall have the same authority at those times with reference to taking bonds or collateral as the clerk of the Municipal Court had on March 3, 1933; shall receive no compensation for these services other than his regular salary; shall be subject to the orders and rules of the Superior Court in discharge of his duties, and may be removed as the clerk at any time by the judges of the court. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have power to authorize the official appointed by the Superior Court to take bond of persons arrested upon writs and process from that court in criminal cases between 4 o'clock postmeridian and 9 o'clock antemeridian and upon Sundays and holidays, and shall have power at any time to revoke the authority granted by it.</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd>(1) An officer or member of the Metropolitan Police Department who arrests without a warrant a person for committing a misdemeanor may, instead of taking him into custody, issue a citation requiring the person to appear before an official of the Metropolitan Police Department designated under subsection (a) of this section to act as a clerk of the Superior Court.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> Whenever a person is arrested without a warrant for committing a misdemeanor and is booked and processed pursuant to law, an official of the Metropolitan Police Department designated under subsection (a) of this section to act as a clerk of the Superior Court may issue a citation to him for an appearance in court or at some other designated place, and release him from custody.</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> No citation may be issued under paragraph (1) or (2) unless the person authorized to issue the citation has reason to believe that the arrested person will not cause injury to persons or damage to property and that he will make an appearance in answer to the citation.</dd>
            
                <dt>4</dt>
                <dd> Whoever willfully fails to appear as required in a citation, shall be fined not more than the maximum provided for the misdemeanor for which such citation was issued or imprisoned for not more than 180 days, or both. Prosecution under this paragraph shall be by the prosecuting officer responsible for prosecuting the offense for which the citation is issued.</dd>
