"The Department of Human Services shall publish a formulary of drug products, with the chemical or generic name of each, that are determined to be therapeutically equivalent to specified brand name drug products. The Department shall determine the contents of the formulary only after recommendations are made by a committee of 9 members appointed by the Director of that Department. The committee shall consist of one licensed physician and one licensed pharmacist employed by the Department, 2 licensed physicians and 3 licensed pharmacists in private practice in the District, and 2 pharmacologists on the faculty of a university in the District. The recommendations of the committee shall require concurrence of a majority of the members of the committee. The committee's recommendations shall be published in the District of Columbia Register as proposed regulations of the Department. The Department's determinations shall be made in accordance with §§ 2-503, 2-504 and 2-505 and published in the District of Columbia Register as final regulations.
