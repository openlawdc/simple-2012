(b) which had read:\n\n\"(b) The Council of the District of Columbia shall have authority to make, and the Commissioner shall have the authority to enforce, such reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary in making effective the provisions of this chapter, but such rules and regulations shall not be contrary to nor inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.\"\n\nD.C. Law 16-191, in subsec. (b), validated a previously made technical correction.\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nFor legislative history of D.C. Law 11-268, see Historical and Statutory Notes following § 31-2501.03.\n\nLaw 15-292, the \"Fire and Casualty Amendment Act of 2004\", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 15-878, which was referred to the Committee on Consumer and Regulatory Affairs.  The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on November 9, 2004, and December 7, 2004, respectively.  Signed by the Mayor on December 29, 2004, it was assigned Act No. 15-688 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review.   D.C. Law 15-292 became effective on April 5, 2005.\n\nFor Law 16-191, see notes following § 31-1131.02.\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402(277) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nDepartment of Insurance abolished: See Historical and Statutory Notes following § 31-2501.03.\n\nDC CODE § 31-2502.01\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Oct. 9, 1940, 54 Stat. 1066, ch. 792, ch.
