                <p>There is established within the General Fund of the District of Columbia a special nonlapsing fund known as the Delinquent Debt Fund ("Fund"). Funds allocated to the Central Collection Unit through the District's annual Budget and Financial Plan, all delinquent debts collected by the Central Collection Unit, and all fees authorized by <a href='./1-350.03.html'>§ 1-350.03</a> shall be deposited into the Fund; provided, that any funds deposited in the Fund before the then-current fiscal year, including any interest earned on such funds before the then-current fiscal year, the money remaining in the Fund after the payment of all costs and expenses accrued before the then-current fiscal year, less 10% of such remainder, which shall be retained as a reserve operating balance, shall be transferred or revert to the General Fund of the District of Columbia.
