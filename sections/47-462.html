Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 19-21 rewrote subsecs. (a)(1), (b)(6), and (d); in subsec. (a)(2), deleted "and" from the end; added subsecs. (a)(4) and (5); in subsec. (b)(2), substituted "recommending potential modifications to tax rates" for "enabling the possibility that general rates might be reduced"; and, in subsec. (c), substituted "June 2, 1998, and entitled 'Taxing Simply, Taxing Fairly"' for "December 5, 1977, pursuant to Council Resolution 1-149" . Prior to amendment, subsecs. (a)(1), (b)(6), and (d) read as follows:

"(1) Mitigate the current tax burden on taxpayers;"

"(6) To conduct an analysis of a split rate approach to real property taxation together with a recommendation as to how it could be structured with minimal effect on taxes paid by the average taxpayer."

"(d) The Commission shall submit to the Council and the Mayor emergency recommendations within 90 days of its appointment and its final report no later than 9 months after the Commission's appointment."

D.C. Law 19-171, in subsec. (a)(3), validated a previously made technical correction in the punctuation.
