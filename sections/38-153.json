Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nEstablishment of District of Columbia Advisory Committee on Education: See Mayor's Order 89-256, November 7, 1989.\n\nEstablishment--D.C.
