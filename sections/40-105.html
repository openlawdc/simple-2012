                <p>To the extent that any lien provided for in this chapter is based on a claim for storage of a motor vehicle in excess of $150, such lien shall be, as to such excess, inferior to the lien of a conditional vendor or chattel mortgagee (as defined in § 40-102) claiming under an instrument recorded on a date earlier than the period to which such charges are attributable.</p>
