        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Prior Codifications

1981 Ed., § 19-302.

1973 Ed., <a href='./19-302.html'>§ 19-302</a>.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-292 rewrote the section which had read:

"When the intestate leaves a surviving spouse and no child, parent, grandchild, brother, or sister, or the child of a brother or sister of the intestate, the surviving spouse is entitled to the whole."

D.C. Law 16-79, in the section heading, substituted "spouse or domestic partner" for "spouse"; in the lead-in language, substituted "surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner" for "surviving spouse"; and, in pars. (2), (4), and (5), substituted "surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner" for "surviving spouse".
