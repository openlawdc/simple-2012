When the net income of a corporation, financial institution, or unincorporated business is derived from sources within and without the District, the taxpayer shall apportion business income and allocate nonbusiness income as provided in this section."

D.C. Law 15-205 rewrote subsec. (i) which had read as follows:

"(i) Definition. -- For purposes of this section, the term 'state' shall include the District of Columbia."
