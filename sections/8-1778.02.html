                <dd> Energy conservation efforts, including the promotion of Energy Efficiency Improvements to residential, commercial, and other real property, are necessary to address the issue of global climate change and to reduce the consumers' energy costs.</dd>

                <dd> The upfront cost of making residential, commercial, or other real property more energy efficient prevents many property owners from making Energy Efficient Improvements. To make Energy Efficient Improvements more accessible and to promote the installation of those improvements, it is necessary to authorize a procedure to provide funds for the initial cost of installing Energy Efficiency Improvements.</dd>

                <dt>e</dt>
                <dd> The Council finds that authorization, issuance, sale, and delivery of bonds for the payment of costs of a program to provide funds for the initial installation of Energy Efficiency Improvements that are permanently attached to residential, commercial, or other real property will contribute to the health, welfare, and safety of residents of the District, are in the public interest, and will accomplish the purposes and intent of § 1-204.90.</dd>
