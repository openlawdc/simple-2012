1981 Ed., § 1-627.10.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-260 added subsec. (d).

D.C. Law 18-82 rewrote subsec. (b); and, in subsec. (c), substituted "that has not vested in accordance with subsection (b) of this section shall be forfeited after separation from employment" for "shall be forfeited upon separation from employment if separation occurs prior to completion of 5 years of creditable service". Prior to amendment, subsec. (b) read as follows:

"(b) The District's contributions to the defined contribution plan under <a href='./1-626.05.html'>§ 1- 626.05(3)</a> and the earnings on the District's contributions shall vest when an employee completes 5 years of creditable service with the District, dies, or becomes entitled to disability benefits under the Social Security Act."

D.C. Law 19-171, in subsec. (b), validated a previously made technical correction.
