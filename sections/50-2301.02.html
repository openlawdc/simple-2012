Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-289 rewrote pars. (1) and (2) which had read:

"(1) The term 'Department' means the District of Columbia Department of Transportation.

"(2) The term 'Director' means the Director of the District of Columbia Department of Transportation."

D.C. Law 14-235 rewrote par. (5a) which had read as follows:

"(5a) The term 'motor vehicle' means all vehicles propelled by an internal-combustion engine, electricity, or steam. The term 'motor vehicle' shall not include traction engines, road rollers, vehicles propelled only upon stationary rails or tracks, and battery-operated wheelchairs when operated by a handicapped person at speeds not exceeding 10 miles per hour."

D.C. Law 15-105, in par. (5a), validated a previously made technical correction.

D.C. Law 16-224, in par. (5a), revived the provisions of D.C. Law 14-235 that expired on October 1, 2005, and substituted "personal mobility devices, as defined by <a href='./50-2201.02.html'>§ 50-2201.02(12)</a>, or a battery-operated wheelchair when operated by a person with a disability" for "electric personal assistive mobility devices, as defined by <a href='./50-2201.02.html'>§ 50-2201.02(12)</a>, and battery-operated wheelchairs when operated by a handicapped person at speeds not exceeding 10 miles per hour".

D.C. Law 16-305, in par. (5a), purported to substitute "person with a disability" for "handicapped person".

D.C. Law 17-303 added pars. (8) and (9).
