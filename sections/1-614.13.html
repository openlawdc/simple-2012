Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-172, in subsec. (a), substituted "on January 15th in subsequent years" for "coincident with annual agency budget submissions in subsequent years"; and rewrote subsec. (b), which previously read:

"The performance report shall, for each performance measure stated in the previous fiscal year's performance plan, indicate the actual level of performance achieved as compared to the stated goal or objective for an acceptable level of performance and the goal or objective for a superior level of performance. The performance report shall also state the position and the immediate supervisor or superior of the District of Columbia management employee most directly responsible for the achievement of each performance measure, as well as the names of the nonmanagement personnel responsible for the accomplishment of the performance measure under management's supervision."
