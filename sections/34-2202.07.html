                <dd> The study recommendations shall include the manner in which the District would be compensated by the Authority for the District's historic investment in the capital improvements and maintenance of the Blue Plains facility, should the Authority become an independent regional authority, as well as options for retention by the District of the land upon which any Authority plant and facilities are located within the boundaries of the District.</dd>
            
                <dt>4</dt>
