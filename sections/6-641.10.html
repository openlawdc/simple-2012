Legislative History of Laws

Law 10-193, the "Comprehensive Plan Amendments Act of 1994," was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 10-212, which was referred to the Committee of the Whole. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on June 7, 1994, and June 21, 1994, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on August 8, 1994, it was assigned Act No. 10-323 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 10-193 became effective on October 6, 1994.

Effective Dates

Section 4(b) of D.C. Law 10-193 provided that no District element of the Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital shall take effect until it has been reviewed by the National Capital Planning Commission as provided in § 2-1002(a) and § 1-204.23.

References in Text

Section 308b of the Comprehensive Plan referred to in (b) is § 308b of Title 10 of the D.C. Municipal Regulations.

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.
