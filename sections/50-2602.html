Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-235 rewrote par. (5) which had read as follows:

"(5) The term 'motor vehicle' means any vehicle propelled by an internal-combustion engine, electricity, or steam. The term 'motor vehicle' shall not include traction engines, road rollers, vehicles propelled only upon rails or tracks, and battery-operated wheelchairs when operated by a handicapped person at speeds not exceeding 10 miles per hour."

D.C. Law 15-35 repealed pars. (6) and (7) which had read as follows:

"(6) The term 'abandoned vehicle' means any motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer:

"(A) That is inoperable and left unattended on public property for more than 72 hours;

"(B) That has remained illegally on public property for more than 72 hours;

"(C) That has remained on public property for more than 72 hours and:

"(i) Is not displaying current valid registration; or

"(ii) Is displaying registration of another vehicle;

"(D) That has remained on private property for more than 30 days and is inoperable in that 1 or more of its major mechanical components, including, but not limited to, engine, transmission, drive train, or wheels, is missing or not functional unless such vehicle is kept in an enclosed building completely shielded from the view of individuals on the adjoining properties; or

"(E) That has remained unclaimed for 45 days after proper notice."

"(7) The term 'junk vehicle' means any vehicle that is wrecked, dismantled, or in irreparable condition."

D.C. Law 15-105, in par. (3), validated a previously made technical correction.

D.C. Law 16-175 repealed par. (3), which had read as follows:

"(3) The term 'Agency' means the Motor Vehicle Parking Agency created in § 50- 2604."

D.C. Law 16-224, in par. (5), revived the provisions of D.C. Law 14-235 that expired on October 1, 2005, and substituted "personal mobility devices, as defined by § 50-2201.02(12), or a battery-operated wheelchair when operated by a person with a disability" for "electric personal assistive mobility devices, as defined by § 50-2201.02(12), and battery-operated wheelchairs when operated by a handicapped person at speeds not exceeding 10 miles per hour".

D.C. Law 16-305, in par. (5), purported to substitute "person with a disability" for "handicapped person".
