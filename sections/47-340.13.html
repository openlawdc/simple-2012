Nothing contained in this subchapter, including, but not limited to, the bonds, the financing documents, the closing documents or the Council resolution, shall be construed as obligating the District to issue any bonds for the benefit of any applicant or to participate in or assist any applicant in any way with financing, refinancing, or reimbursing the costs of the development of any project. The applicant shall have no claims for damages or for any other legal or equitable relief against the District, its elected or appointed officials, officers, employees, or agents as a consequence of any failure to issue any bonds for the benefit of any applicant.</dd>

Neither the applicant, any purchaser of the bonds, nor any other person shall rely upon the District with respect to these matters.</dd>
