Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, § 711 (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.11.html'>§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.14.html'>§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.

Miscellaneous Notes

Compensation for board members of Agency: <a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%20103-127'>Section 120(c) of Pub. L. 103-127</a>, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=107&page=1346'>107 Stat. 1346</a>, the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 1994, provided that notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the Board of Directors of the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency shall be paid, during any fiscal year, a per diem compensation at a rate established by the Mayor.

D.C. Law 14-188 repealed this section on a permanent basis. D.C. Law 15-39 also purported to repeal this section. The repeal by D.C. Law 15-39 was ineffective.
