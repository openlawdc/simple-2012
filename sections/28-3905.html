                <dt>a</dt>
                <dd> A case is begun by filing with the Department a complaint plainly describing a trade practice and stating the complainant's (and, if different, the consumer's) name and address, the name and address (if known) of the respondent, and such other information as the Director may require. The complaint must be in or reduced by the Director to writing. The filing of a complaint with the Department shall toll the periods for limitation of time for bringing an action as set out in section 12-301 until the complaint has been resolved through an administrative order, consent decree, or dismissal in accordance with this section or until an opportunity to arbitrate has been provided in Chapter 5 of Title 50.</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Director shall investigate each such complaint and determine:</dd>
            
                <dt>A</dt>
                <dd> What trade practice actually occurred; and</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> Whether the trade practice which occurred violates any statute, regulation, rule of common law, or other law of the District of Columbia.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> The Director may, in his or her discretion, decline to prosecute certain cases as necessary to manage the Department's caseload and control program costs.</dd>
            
                <dt>b-1</dt>
                <dd> In carrying out an investigation and determination pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Director shall consult the respondent and such other available sources of information, and make such other efforts, as are appropriate and necessary to carry out such duties.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> If at any time the Director finds that the trade practice complained of may, in whole or in part, be a violation of law other than a law of the District of Columbia or a law within the jurisdiction of the Department, the Director may in writing so inform the complainant, respondent and officials of the District, the United States, or other jurisdiction, who would properly enforce such law.</dd>
            
                <dt>d</dt>
                <dd> The director shall determine that there are, or are not, reasonable grounds to believe that a trade practice, in violation of a law of the District of Columbia within the jurisdiction of the Department, has occurred in any part or all of the case. The Director may find that there are not such reasonable grounds for any of the following reasons:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> any violation of law which may have occurred is of a law not of the District of Columbia or not within the jurisdiction of the Department, or occurred more than three years prior to the filing of the complaint;</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> in case paragraph (1) of this subsection does not apply, no trade practice occurred in violation of any law of the District;</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> the respondent cannot be identified or located, or would not be subject to the personal jurisdiction of a District of Columbia court;</dd>
            
                <dt>4</dt>
                <dd> the complainant, to the Director's knowledge, no longer seeks redress in the case;</dd>
            
                <dt>5</dt>

                <dt>6</dt>
                <dd> the complainant can no longer be located.</dd>
            
                <dt>d-1</dt>
                <dd> The Director may dismiss any part or all of a case to which one or more of the reasons stated in subsection (d) of this section apply. The Director shall inform all parties in writing of the determination, and, if any part or all of the case is dismissed, shall specify which of the reasons in this subsection applies to which part of the case, and such other detail as is necessary to explain the dismissal.</dd>
            
                <dt>e</dt>
                <dd> The Director may attempt to settle, in accordance with subsection (h) of this section, each case for which reasonable grounds are found in accordance with subsection (d-1) of this section. After the Director's determination as to whether the complaint is within the Department's jurisdiction, in accordance with subsection (d-1) of this section, the Director shall:</dd>

                <dt>4</dt>
                <dd> notify all parties of another action taken, with the reasons therefor stated in detail and supported by fact. Reasons may include:</dd>
            
                <dt>A</dt>
                <dd> any reason listed in subsections (d)(1) through (d)(6) of this section; and</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> that the presentation of a charge to the Office of Adjudication would not serve the purposes of this chapter.</dd>

                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd> When the case is transmitted to the Office of Adjudication, the Chief of the Office of Compliance shall sign, and serve the respondent, the Department's summons to answer or appear before the Office of Adjudication. Not less than 15 nor more than 90 days after such transmittal, the case shall be heard. The case shall proceed under section 10 of the District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act (section 2-509). The Office of Adjudication may, without delaying its hearing or decision, attempt to settle the case pursuant to subsection (h) of this section, and has discretion to permit any stipulation or consent decree the parties agree to. The Director shall be a party on behalf of the complainant. Applications to intervene shall be decided as may be proper or required by law or rule. Reasonable discovery shall be freely allowed. Any finding or decision may be modified or set aside, in whole or part, before a notice of appeal is filed in the case, or the time to so file has run out.</dd>
            
                <dt>g</dt>
                <dd> If, after hearing the evidence, the Office of Adjudication decides a trade practice occurred in which the respondent violated a law of the District of Columbia within the jurisdiction of the Department, such Office of Adjudication shall issue an order which:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> shall require the respondent to cease and desist from such conduct;</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>

                <dt>5</dt>
                <dd> may include such other findings, stipulations, conditions, directives, and remedies including punitive damages, treble damages, or reasonable attorney's fees, as are reasonable and necessary to identify, correct, or prevent the conduct which violated District law; and</dd>
            
                <dt>6</dt>
                <dd> may be based, in whole or part, upon a violation of a law establishing or regulating a type of business, occupational or professional license or permit, and may refer the case for further proceedings to an appropriate board or commission, but may not suspend or revoke a license or permit if there is a board or commission which oversees the specific type of license or permit.</dd>
            
                <dt>h</dt>
                <dd>(1) At any time after reasonable grounds are found in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, the respondent, the Department (represented by (i) the Director prior to transmittal to the Office of Adjudication and after an order issued pursuant to subsection (f) of this section has been appealed, and (ii) the Office of Adjudication after transmittal to the Office of Adjudication and prior to such appeal), and the complainant, may agree to settle all or part of the case by a written consent decree which may:</dd>

                <dd> all parts of a case have been dismissed by operation of subsection (d) or (e) of this section; or</dd>
            
                <dt>C</dt>
                <dd> the Director dismisses an entire case in accordance with subsection (h)(2) of this section.</dd>
            
                <dt>1A</dt>
                <dd> Such appeals shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures and standards of section 11 of the District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act (section 2-510), and take into account the procedural duties placed upon the Department in this section and all actions taken by the Department in the case.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>

                <dd>(A) Any person found to have executed a trade practice in violation of a law of the District of Columbia within the jurisdiction of the Department:</dd>
            
                <dt>i</dt>
                <dd> shall be liable to the Department for a civil penalty of not exceeding $1000.00 for each violation enumerated in an order pursuant to subsection (g)(3) of this section; and</dd>
            
                <dt>ii</dt>
                <dd> may be assessed and made liable to the Department for a civil penalty of not exceeding $1000.00 for each violation or failure to adhere to a provision, of an order described in subsection (f), (g), or (j) of this section or a consent decree described in subsection (h) of this section.</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> The Department, the complainant, or the respondent may sue in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for a remedy, enforcement, or assessment or collection of a civil penalty, when any violation, or failure to adhere to a provision of a consent decree described in subsection (h) of this section, or an order described in subsection (f), (g), or (j) of this section, has occurred. The Department shall sue in that Court for assessment of a civil penalty when an order described in subsection (g) of this section has been issued and become final. A failure by the Department or any person to file suit or prosecute under this subparagraph in regard to any provision or violation of a provision of any consent decree or order, shall not constitute a waiver of such provision or any right under such provision. The Court shall levy the appropriate civil penalties, and may order, if supported by evidence, temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctions, damages, treble damages, reasonable attorney's fees, consumer redress, or other remedy. The Court may set aside the final order if the Court determines that the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs lacked jurisdiction over the respondent or that the complaint was frivolous. If, after considering an application to set aside an order of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, the Court determines that the application was frivolous or that the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs lacked jurisdiction, the Court shall award reasonable attorney's fees.</dd>

                <dt>j</dt>
                <dd> If, at any time before notice of appeal from a decision made according to subsection (f) of this section is filed or the time to so file has run out, the Director believes that legal action is necessary to preserve the subject matter of the case, to prevent further injury to any party, or to enable the Department ultimately to order a full and fair remedy in the case, the Chief of the Office of Compliance shall present the matter to the Office of Adjudication, which may issue a cease and desist order to take effect immediately, or grant such other relief as will assure a just adjudication of the case, in accordance with such beliefs of the Director which are substantiated by evidence. The Office of Adjudication's ruling may be appealed to court within 7 days of notice thereof on the Director, respondent, and complainant.</dd>
