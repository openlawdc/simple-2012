                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd>(1) The contracting officer may issue an RFQ before an RFP if the CPO makes a determination and findings that proceeding with an RFQ process would be advantageous to the District and that establishes a reasonable price range for the procurement.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> The RFQ shall include a description of the statement of work to be solicited by the RFP, the deadline for submission of information, and how prospective offerors may apply for consideration.

                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> Rank the prospective contractors from most advantageous to least advantageous to the District.</dd>
            
                <dt>h</dt>
                <dd>(1) After ranking the prospective contractors, the contracting officer may elect to proceed with negotiations in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection. The contracting officer's decision shall not be subject to review.</dd>

                <dd> If the contracting officer elects to proceed with negotiations, the contracting officer shall negotiate with the highest-ranked prospective contractor on price or matters affecting the scope of the contract, so long as the terms of the final contract are within the scope of the request for proposals.

                <dt>3</dt>
