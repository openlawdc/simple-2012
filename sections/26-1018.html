                <dd> An authorized delegate to whom an order is issued under this section may apply to the Superintendent to modify or rescind such order. The Superintendent shall not grant such application unless the Superintendent finds that it is in the public interest to do so and that it is reasonable to believe that such person will, if such person is permitted to resume being an authorized delegate of a licensee, comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and of any regulation or order issued under this chapter.</dd>
