Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-297 rewrote the section which had read:

"(a) After April 19, 1977, no producer, refiner, or manufacturer of motor fuels as the terms are defined in § 36-301.01(10) and (12) shall open a retail service station in the District of Columbia, irrespective of whether or not such retail service station will be operated under a trademark owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by such producer, refiner, or manufacturer, unless such retail service station is to be operated by a person or entity other than either an employee, servant, commissioned agent or subsidiary of such producer, refiner, or manufacturer or a person or entity who operates or manages such retail service station under a contract with such producer, refiner, or manufacturer which provides for a fee arrangement.

"(b) After January 1, 1981, no producer, refiner, or manufacturer of motor fuels as the terms are defined in § 36-301.01(10) and (12) shall operate a retail service station in the District of Columbia, irrespective of whether or not such retail service station will be operated under a trademark owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by such producer, refiner, or manufacturer, with employees, servants, commissioned agents, or subsidiaries of such producer, refiner, or manufacturer or with a person or entity who operates or manages such retail service station under a contract with such producer, refiner, or manufacturer which provides for a fee arrangement. However, any entity, which as of October 9, 1979, operates a retail service station in the District of Columbia, and of which a producer, refiner, or manufacturer as defined in § 36-301.01(12) only has no more than 49 per centum voting control, may continue to operate such station after January 1, 1981, so long as no producer, refiner or manufacturer as defined in § 36-301.01(12) only has more than 49 per centum voting control of the entity."

D.C. Law 17-80, in subsecs. (a) and (b), deleted "jobbers," preceding "producer"; and repealed subsec. (c) which had read as follows:

Section 2 of D.C. Law 17-6 amended subsec. (c) to read as follows:

"(c) Any jobber in violation of subsections (a) or (b) of this subsection as of April 8, 2005, shall come into compliance by January 1, 2008."

Section 4(a) of D.C. Law 17-6 provides that the act shall expire after 225 days of its having taken effect.
