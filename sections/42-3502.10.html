                <dd> On petition by the housing provider, the Rent Administrator may approve a rent adjustment to cover the cost of capital improvements to a rental unit or housing accommodation if:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> The improvement would protect or enhance the health, safety, and security of the tenants or the habitability of the housing accommodation; or</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> The improvement will effect a net saving in the use of energy by the housing accommodation, or is intended to comply with applicable environmental protection regulations, if any savings in energy costs are passed on to the tenants.</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> The housing provider shall establish to the satisfaction of the Rent Administrator:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> That the improvement would be considered depreciable under the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.);</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> The amount and cost of the improvement including interest and service charges; and</dd>

                <dd> Any decision of the Rent Administrator under this section shall determine the adjustment of the rent charged:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> In the case of building-wide major capital improvement, by dividing the cost over a 96-month period of amortization and by dividing the result by the number of rental units in the housing accommodation. No increase under this paragraph may exceed 20% above the current rent charged;</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> In the case of limited improvements to 1 or more rental units in a housing accommodation, by dividing the cost over a 64-month period of amortization and by dividing this result by the number of rental units receiving the improvement.

The Rent Administrator shall make a determination that the interests of the affected tenants are being protected; and</dd>

When the housing provider has recovered all costs, including interest and service charges, the housing provider shall recompute and adjust the rent charged to reflect the abatement of the capital improvement rent increase.</dd>

                <dd> Plans, contracts, specifications, and permits relating to capital improvements shall be retained for 1 year by the housing provider or its designated agent for inspection by affected tenants as the tenants may request at the housing provider's place of business in the District during working hours.

                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd> Any tenant displaced from a rental unit by the capital improvement of the unit or the housing accommodation under this section shall have a right to rerent the rental unit immediately upon the completion of the work.</dd>

                <dd> The housing provider may make capital improvements to the property before the approval of the rent adjustment by the Rent Administrator for the capital improvements where the capital improvements are immediately necessary to maintain the health or safety of the tenants.</dd>
            
                <dt>h</dt>
