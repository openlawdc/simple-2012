Editor's Notes

"District of Columbia Council", appearing twice in (a) and once in (c), should probably be "Council of the District of Columbia" or "Council", in view of <a href='./1-1502.html'>§ 1- 1502(1)(B)</a> and the fact that this section refers to current and ongoing Council activity.

Uniform Law

This section is based upon § 5 of the Uniform Law Commissioners' Model State Administrative Procedure Act (1961 Act). See 15 Uniform Laws Annotated, Master Edition, or ULA Database on Westlaw.
