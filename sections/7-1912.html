                <dt>5</dt>
                <dd> Any health-care administrator or health professional licensed in the District who willfully fails to make a report required by § 7-1903(a)(1), or willfully makes a report under § 7-1903 containing information that he or she knows to be false, shall be guilty of unprofessional conduct and subject to any sanction available to the governmental board, commission, or other authority responsible for his or her licensure.</dd>

                <dd>(1) Any person who is aggrieved by a violation of this chapter, or who is acting on or in behalf of a person aggrieved by a violation of this chapter, may maintain an action in court to enjoin the continuation of that violation or the commission of any future violation. In any such action that challenges the adequacy of protective services provided under § 7-1905(a), the court may direct the Mayor to provide additional or different services only upon a finding of bad-faith noncompliance. Should such a finding be made, days on which, in the opinion of the court, the services provided were grossly inadequate shall not be counted against the 90-day limitation in § 7- 1905(a)(2). Actions brought under this paragraph shall, commensurate with the exigency of the circumstances alleged, be expedited pursuant to procedures to be established by the court.</dd>

                <dd> No right to monetary relief shall lie against the District for a violation of this chapter. Denial of such a right, however, shall in no way be construed to limit or impede any other action for monetary relief that might be available pursuant to other federal or District law.</dd>
