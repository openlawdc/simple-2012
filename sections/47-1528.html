Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-217 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"(a) If a deficiency in tax is determined or redetermined by the Mayor, then the Mayor shall mail, by certified mail, a notice of the deficiency to the taxpayer.

"(b) Unless, within 30 days after the notice of the deficiency is sent, the person against whom it is assessed requests, in writing, a hearing, or unless the Mayor decides to redetermine the deficiency, the Mayor's determination under subsection (a) of this section shall establish irrevocably the amount of the tax.

"(c) If the person requests a hearing pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Mayor shall provide a hearing.

"(d) As soon as practicable after the hearing or redetermination, the Mayor shall render a decision and notify the person against whom the tax is assessed of the Mayor's final decision on the matter."

D.C. Law 16-191 repealed section 79 of D.C. Law 15-354 which had amended this section.
