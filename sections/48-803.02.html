"(a)(1) When a pharmacist receives a prescription for a brand name drug, the pharmacist may dispense a generically equivalent drug product that is listed in the Orange Book; provided, that the pharmacist shall dispense a generically equivalent drug product if requested by the purchaser, except as provided in § 48-803.02.
