Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 18-118 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:

"The pharmacist shall not dispense an equivalent drug product under § 48-803.02 if:

"(1) The person purchasing the drug product or the patient for whom it is intended indicates a preference for the drug product actually prescribed;

"(2) The prescriber, in the case of a written prescription order signed by the prescriber, writes in the prescriber's own handwriting 'dispense as written' or 'D.A.W.' or a similar notation. A procedure for checking or initialing a box, preprinted or stamped on a prescription form, will not constitute an acceptable notation;

"(3) The prescriber, in the case of a prescription communicated by telephone, expressly indicates the prescription is to be dispensed as communicated, and this indication is noted in the pharmacist's own handwriting in the manner provided in subsection (b) of this section."
