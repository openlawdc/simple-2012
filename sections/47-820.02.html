                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> The base assessment amount shall be the amount paid by the current property owner in exchange for the property, not including any grants or other amounts received by the property owner from government agencies, housing organizations, and other entities that are not likely to be repaid (absent a violation of the terms of the limitations, encumbrances, or other restrictions attached to the sale).</dd>
