Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-132, rewrote subsec. (a); and added subsec. (d). Subsec. (a) had read as follows:

"(a) Before the Superintendent takes any action under § 26-1117 or § 26-1118, the Superintendent shall give the licensee an opportunity for a hearing."

D.C. Law 18-38 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:

"(a) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the Commissioner shall give the licensee an opportunity for a hearing before the Commissioner takes any action under § 26-1117 and § 26-1118.

"(b) Notice of the hearing shall be given to the licensee and the hearing shall be held in accordance with the contested case provisions of subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2.

"(c) The hearing notice to the licensee shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the principal place of business of the licensee at least 30 days before the hearing.

"(d) If the Commissioner determines that an emergency condition exists that may endanger the public health or safety of the District due to noncompliance with this chapter, the Commissioner may issue a temporary cease and desist order to require a licensee, or a person required to have a license, to cease operations immediately; provided, that the duration of a temporary cease and desist order issued under this subsection shall not exceed 30 days and the order includes notice of a hearing to be held within 30 days of the order to be held pursuant to subsection (b) and (c) of this section. Any person subject to a cease and desist order may appeal the order within 15 days, but shall be required to comply with the order pending appeal."
