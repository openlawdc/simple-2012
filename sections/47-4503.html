        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-307, in subsecs. (a), (f), and (m), a new sentence was added to the end of each subsection; subsec. (g) was rewritten; and subsecs. (h) through (k) were repealed. Prior to amendment, subsecs. (g), (h), (i), (j), and (k) had read as follows:

"(g) An account owner may transfer all or a portion of an account to another account whose designated beneficiary is a member of the family.

"(h) Changes in designated beneficiaries and transfers shall not be permitted to the extent that they would constitute excess contributions or unauthorized investment choices.

"(i) In the case of a nonqualified withdrawal from an account, an amount equal to 10% of the portion of the withdrawal constituting income under § 529 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be withheld as a penalty and paid to the Program fund established by the Chief Financial Officer.

"(j) The penalty described in subsection (i) of this section may be adjusted by the Chief Financial Officer so that the penalty is not de minimis under § 529 of the Internal Revenue Code; provided, that the Chief Financial Officer shall adjust the penalty to an amount that is not greater than is required under § 529 of the Internal Revenue Code; provided further, that the penalty, when combined with other revenue generated under this chapter, shall produce more revenue than is required to meet the costs of operating the Program and recover any prior costs not previously recovered.

"(k) If an account owner makes a nonqualified withdrawal and no penalty is withheld under subsection (i) of this section, or the amount withheld was less than the penalty required to be paid, the account owner shall pay the unpaid portion of the penalty to the Program upon the earlier of:

"(1) The filing of the account owner's District of Columbia income tax return for the taxable year of the withdrawal (determined with respect for any authorized extensions); or

"(2) If the account owner does not file a return, the due date for the return."
