                <dd> If there is a reasonable suspicion to believe that the person is operating or in physical control of any vessel or watercraft while under the influence of, or intoxicated by, alcohol or a controlled substance, he or she shall be deemed to have given consent for 2 chemical tests of the person's blood, urine, or breath for the purpose of determining the person's blood-alcohol or drug content. If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test under this section, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia shall order the person not to operate any vessel or watercraft for at least one year.</dd>

                <dd> Chemical tests shall be performed on all operators involved in a fatal accident. If a person who operates or is in physical control of any vessel or watercraft is declared dead by competent authority, the person shall be deemed to have given his or her consent to chemical tests as soon as practical after the death has been declared to be the result of a fatal accident.</dd>
            
                <dt>e</dt>
                <dd> The refusal to submit to either of the 2 tests required in this section shall be admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding arising as a result of the acts alleged to have been committed by the person before the arrest. A refusal to submit to any test as required by this section shall constitute a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a $500 fine, imprisonment of 90 days, or both.</dd>
