1981 Ed., § 21-527.

1973 Ed., <a href='./21-527.html'>§ 21-527</a>.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-283 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"<a href='./21-527.html'>§ 21-527</a>. Examination and release of person; notice."

"The chief of service of a hospital in which a person is hospitalized under a court order entered pursuant to <a href='./21-524.html'>section 21-524</a> shall, within 48 hours after the order is entered, have the person examined by a physician or qualified psychologist. If the physician or qualified psychologist, after his examination, certifies that in his opinion the person is not mentally ill to the extent that he is likely to injure himself or others if not presently detained, the person shall be immediately released. The chief of service shall, within 48 hours after the examination has been completed, send a copy of the results thereof by certified or registered mail to the spouse, parents, attorney, legal guardian, or nearest known adult relative of the person examined."

D.C. Law 17-231 substituted "spouse or domestic partner" for "spouse".

"(a) The chief clinical officer of the Department or the chief of service of a hospital in which a person is hospitalized under a court order entered pursuant to <a href='./21-524.html'>section 21-524</a> shall, within 48 hours after the order is entered, have the person examined by a psychiatrist or qualified psychologist. If the psychiatrist or qualified psychologist, after his examination, certifies that in his opinion the person is not mentally ill to the extent that the person is likely to injure himself or others if not presently detained, the person shall be immediately released. The chief of service shall immediately notify the chief clinical officer of the Department of the results of the examination by telephone, telefax, or other electronic means and shall, within 48 hours after the examination has been completed, send a copy of the results by mail to the spouse, parents, attorney, legal guardian, or nearest known adult relative of the person examined, if authorized by the person who is hospitalized consistent with the provisions of the District of Columbia Mental Health Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979 (D.C. Law 2-136; D.C. Official Code <a href='./7-1201.01.html'>§ 7-1201.01</a> et seq.).

"(b) The chief clinical officer of the Department or the chief of service of a hospital in which a person is detained under a court order entered pursuant to <a href='./21-524.html'>section 21-524</a> or under <a href='./21-526.html'>section 21-526(c)</a> shall immediately release the person from the emergency detention in a hospital if, at any time during the detention, a psychiatrist or psychologist at the hospital or the Department certifies that, based on an examination, it is his opinion that the person is no longer mentally ill to the extent that the person is likely to injure himself or others if not presently detained or that the person could be treated in a less restrictive setting. The chief of service shall immediately notify the chief clinical officer of the Department of the results of the examination by telephone, telefax, or other electronic means and shall, within 48 hours after the examination has been completed, send a copy of the results by mail to the spouse, parents, attorney, legal guardian, or nearest known adult relative of the person examined, if authorized by the person who was examined consistent with the provisions of the District of Columbia Mental Health Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979 (D.C. Law 2-136; D.C. Official Code <a href='./7-1201.01.html'>§ 7-1201.01</a> et seq.)."
