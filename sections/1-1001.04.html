Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 18-103 rewrote subsec. (a); and added subsec. (b)(3A). Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) read as follows:

"(a) No person shall be a member of the Board unless he or she qualifies as an elector and resides in the District. No person may be appointed to the Board unless he or she has resided in the District continuously since the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the day he or she is appointed. Members of the Board shall hold no other paid office or employment in the District government and shall hold no active office, position or employment in the federal government. Not more than 2 members shall be members of the same political party."

D.C. Law 19-124, in the section heading, substituted "Board of Elections" for "Board of Elections and Ethics".

D.C. Law 19-168 rewrote subsec. (c), which formerly read:

"(c)(1) Each member of the Board, excluding the Chairman, shall receive compensation, as provided in <a href='./1-611.08.html'>§ 1-611.08</a>, while actually in the service of the Board, not to exceed the sum of $12,500 per annum."

"(2) The Chairman of the Board shall receive compensation, as provided in § 1 611.08, while actually in the service of the Board, not to exceed the sum of $26,500 per annum."
