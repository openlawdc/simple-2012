        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-42 validated a previously made technical correction in subsec. (d).

D.C. Law 13-313, rewrote subsec. (d); and, in subsec. (f), substituted "Except for matching funds used for an approved purpose under <a href='./1-307.68.html'>§ 1-307.68(a)</a> before 10 years after the establishment of the opportunity account,"for "Except for matching funds used to purchase a federally qualified individual retirement account as permitted under <a href='./1-307.68.html'>§ 1-307.68(a)(8)</a>". Prior to amendment, subsec. (d) read:

"(d) Subject to appropriations, matching funds deposited into a matching funds account or withdrawn by an account holder from a matching funds account shall be exempt from taxation under District of Columbia law; provided, that:

"(1) Interest earned on the matching funds shall not be exempt from taxation; and

"(2) Any money withdrawn from a matching funds account for an unapproved use shall be taxed as income unless it is reinstated in the account as provided in section 9(d)."

D.C. Law 18-111, in subsecs. (b) and (d), substituted "Subject to annual available appropriations" for "Subject to appropriations".
