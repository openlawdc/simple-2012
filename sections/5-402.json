L. 95-228, § 1. 5 U.S.C. § 3319 was repealed October 13, 1978, 92 Stat. 1149, Pub. L. 95- 454, § 307. For provisions similar to these repealed sections, see 5 U.S.C. § 7201 et seq., generally. Former 5 U.S.C. § 7152 was transferred October 13, 1978, by 92 Stat. 1216, Pub. L. 95-454 to 5 U.S.C. § 7202. Appropriate changes have been made in the text of this section.\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402(107) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nOffice of Chief Engineer abolished: The Office of Chief Engineer of the Fire Department was abolished and all functions of that office transferred to and vested in the Fire Chief. The Deputy Chief Engineer of the Fire Department was designated \"Deputy Fire Chief,\" and the Battalion Chief Engineer was designated \"Battalion Fire Chief\" by Reorganization Order No. 6, dated September 16, 1952, issued pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. Reorganization Order No. 38, dated June 18, 1953, established a Fire Department headed by the Fire Chief. The Fire Chief was given full authority over the Department to be exercised in accordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The Order set up the organization of the Department, and provided that the previously existing Fire Department was abolished and its functions transferred to the new Department. This Order was issued pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. Reorganization Order No. 38 was amended by Mayor's Order 81-233a, dated November 9, 1981. That Order set forth the organization of the Fire Department.\n\nApplication of Titles I and VI of D.C. Law 15-194: Section 1301 of D.C.
