Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402(94) and (95) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.

Delegation of Authority

Delegation of Authority--Secretary of the District of Columbia, see Mayor's Order 95-26, January 27, 1995.

Delegation of Authority--Office of the Secretary, see Mayor's Order 97-87, May 6, 1997 (44 DCR 2958).

Miscellaneous Notes

Boards established: Reorganization Order No. 48 of the Board of Commissioners, dated June 26, 1953, established in the government of the District of Columbia a Regular Police Trial Board, a Special Police Trial Board, and a Complaint Review Board to operate in accordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The Order set forth the purpose, manner of selection of members, and the functions of the Boards, and abolished the previously existing Police Trial and Review Boards. This Order was issued pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952.
