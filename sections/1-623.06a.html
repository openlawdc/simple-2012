"(a) The Mayor shall require each employee receiving benefits under this title to report his or her earnings from employment or self-employment, by affidavit or otherwise, including by providing copies of tax documents or authorization for the Mayor to obtain copies of tax documents, in the manner and at the times the Mayor specifies. The employee shall include in the affidavit or report the value of housing, board, lodging, and other advantages which are part of his or her earnings in employment or self-employment and which can be estimated in money.

"(b) An employee forfeits his or her right to compensation with respect to any period for which the affidavit or report was required if the employee:

"(1) Fails to file a complete affidavit or report when required; or

"(2) Knowingly omits or understates any part of his or her earnings.

"(c) Compensation forfeited under this section, if already paid, shall be recovered by a deduction from the compensation payable to the employee or otherwise recovered under section 2329 unless recovery is waived under that section.".
