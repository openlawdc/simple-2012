"The Family Division, if it is exercising personal jurisdiction over a nonresident under <a href='./46-302.01.html'>§ 46-302.01</a>, may apply <a href='./46-303.15.html'>§ 46-303.15</a> (special rules of evidence and procedure) to receive evidence from another state, and <a href='./46-303.17.html'>§ 46-303.17</a> (assistance with discovery) to obtain discovery through a tribunal of another state. In all other respects, subchapters III through VII of this chapter do not apply and the tribunal shall apply the procedural and substantive law of the District, including the rules on choice of law other than those established by this chapter."
