Nothing in the foregoing shall be read as eliminating the criteria, established either by rule or statute, that govern the awarding of any license affected by this section.\n\n\"(c) Class A licenses shall be required of businesses engaged in the following license endorsement categories:\n\n\"(1) Alcoholic beverages, except that a master business license bearing an Alcoholic Beverages endorsement shall also indicate the class of endorsement applicable for the licensed business;\n\n\"(2) Educational Services;\n\n\"(3) Entertainment;\n\n\"(4) Environmental Materials;\n\n\"(5) Financial Services;\n\n\"(6)(A) Housing: transient; and\n\n\"(B) Housing: residential;\n\n\"(7) Inspected Sales and Services;\n\n\"(8) Manufacturing;\n\n\"(9) Motor Vehicle Sales, Service, and Repair;\n\n\"(10)(A) Public Health: health care facility;\n\n\"(B) Public Health: human services facility;\n\n\"(C) Public Health: child health and welfare;\n\n\"(D) Public Health: public accommodations;\n\n\"(E) Public Health: pharmacy and pharmacology;\n\n\"(F) Public Health: funeral establishment;\n\n\"(G) Public Health: radioactive materials;\n\n\"(H) Public health: biohazard;\n\n\"(I) Public Health: food establishment wholesale; and\n\n\"(J) Public Health: food establishment retail; and\n\n\"(11) Public safety;\n\n\"(d) Class B licenses shall be required of businesses engaged in the following license endorsement categories:\n\n\"(1) Employment Services;\n\n\"(2) General Sales;\n\n\"(3) General Services and Repair; and\n\n\"(4) General Business.\n\n\"(e) The following licenses shall not be a part of the master business license system, and shall be regulated by the Department of Health:\n\n\"(1) Dog-Spayed; and\n\n\"(2) Dog-Unspayed.\n\n\"(f) Any business, not required to obtain a Class A license, whether or not defined in any District statute or regulation, must obtain a Class B license. A business whose practice does not come under the coverage of one of the above named categories, and which is not subject to inspection, must obtain a Class B license under the 'General business' endorsement category.\n\n\"(g) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the Director by regulation, or the Council by statute, from establishing new Class A license or Class B license categories or eliminating existing categories as the Director or Council deems necessary and appropriate. The Department shall maintain and periodically update a schedule of current license categories and classes.\n\n\"(h) The Department shall maintain and periodically update a roster of all licensed businesses, indicating whether they possess Class A licenses or Class B licenses.\"\n\nD.C.
