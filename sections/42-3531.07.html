        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-236 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"The Office shall:

"(1) Provide education and outreach to tenants and the community about laws, rules, and other policy matters involving rental housing, including tenant rights under the petition process and formation of tenant organizations;

"(2) Represent the interest of tenants in legislative, executive, and judicial issues, including advocating changes in laws and rules and reviewing landlord petitions on behalf of tenants;

"(3) Advise tenants on filing complaints and petitions, including petitions in response to disputes with landlords;

"(4) Advise and assisting tenants at conciliation meetings;

"(5) Represent tenants in court or administrative proceedings;

"(6) Organize tenant participation in building-wide inspections; and

"(7) Operate a Tenant Phone Hotline and Tenant Center."

D.C. Law 16-181, in par. (2), substituted "interests" for "interest"; rewrote par. (5); in par. (6), deleted "and" from the end; and added par. (6A). Prior to amendment, par. (5) read as follows:

"(5) Represent tenants and tenant organizations in court or administrative proceedings;"

D.C. Law 19-21 rewrote par. (6A), which formerly read:

"(6A) Manage and administer the Housing Assistance Fund established by <a href='./42-3403.07.html'>§ 42- 3403.07</a>; and"
