"(b) No revenues deposited into this continuing, nonlapsing fund may be obligated or spent in any year without a Congressional appropriation. Revenues in this continuing, nonlapsing special account that are carried over into a succeeding fiscal year may not be obligated or spent in the succeeding year without a new Congressional appropriation that permits such obligation or expenditure.

"(c) Any person issued or renewing a license under this chapter shall pay, in addition to licensing and renewal fees established by the Mayor, a sum to be established by the Mayor for deposit into the Fund.

"(f) If a licensee fails to pay the amount assessed by the Mayor within the time prescribed by rule, his or her license shall be automatically suspended.
