        <dl>
            
                <dt>a</dt>
                <dd> Notwithstanding section 16-2335, a person who has been arrested for violation of the District of Columbia Official Code or the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations, or has been the subject of a petition filed pursuant to section 16-2305 and whose prosecution has been terminated without adjudication may file a motion with the Family Court at any time to seal all of the records of the arrest and related court proceedings on grounds of actual innocence.</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> The burden is on the movant to establish that:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> The violation for which the person was arrested or petitioned did not occur; or</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> The movant did not commit the offense.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> If the motion is filed within 4 years after the prosecution has been terminated, the movant must satisfy the burden described in subsection (b) of this section by a preponderance of the evidence.</dd>
            
                <dt>d</dt>
                <dd> If the motion is filed more than 4 years after the prosecution has been terminated, the movant must satisfy the burden described in subsection (b) of this section by clear and convincing evidence.</dd>
            
                <dt>e</dt>
                <dd> In determining such motions, the Family Court may, but is not required to, employ a rebuttable presumption that the movant is not entitled to relief if the court finds that the government has been substantially prejudiced in its ability to respond to the motion by the delay in its filing, unless the movant shows that the motion is based on grounds which the person could not have raised by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the circumstances prejudicial to the government occurred.</dd>
            
                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd> An acquittal does not establish a presumption that the movant is innocent or entitled to relief pursuant to this section.</dd>
            
                <dt>g</dt>
                <dd> A person whose adjudication has been vacated pursuant to section 16- 2335.01(g)(2), and whose subsequent prosecution is terminated without adjudication, may file a motion with the Family Court pursuant to subsection (a) of this section or any other provision of law.</dd>
            
                <dt>h</dt>

                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd>(A) The Family Court shall summarize in the order the factual circumstances of the challenged arrest and any post-arrest occurrences it deems relevant, and, if the facts support such a conclusion, shall rule as a matter of law that the movant did not commit the offense for which the movant was arrested or that no offense had been committed.</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> A copy of the order shall be provided to the movant or his or her counsel.</dd>

                <dd>(A) In a case involving co-respondents or co-defendants in which the Family Court orders the movant's records sealed, the Family Court may order that only those records, or portions thereof, relating solely to the movant be sealed.</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> The Family Court shall order that the movant's name be redacted to the extent practicable from records that are not sealed. The Family Court may make an in camera inspection of these records in order to make this determination.</dd>
            
                <dt>C</dt>
                <dd> The Family Court need not order the redaction of references to the movant that appear in a transcript of court proceedings involving the co-defendants.</dd>
            
                <dt>D</dt>
                <dd> After references to the movant have been redacted as provided for in this paragraph, the Court shall order those records relating to co-defendants returned to the prosecutor or the Clerk of the Superior Court ("Clerk").</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>

                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> Order the prosecutor to arrange for any computerized record of the movant's arrest, prosecution, or adjudication to be eliminated except for a restricted-access file that would permit the prosecutor and law enforcement agencies to retrieve sealed records if ordered to do so by the Court; and</dd>
            
                <dt>C</dt>
                <dd> Expressly allow the prosecutor and law enforcement agencies to maintain a publicly available record so long as it is not retrievable by the identification of the movant.</dd>
            
                <dt>5</dt>
                <dd> The Family Court shall order the prosecutor, any relevant law enforcement agency, the Department of Youth Rehabilitative Services, and any other public or private agencies or institutions that provided supervision or treatment, or had custody of the person, if the supervision, treatment, or custody was under an order issued by the Family Court to file a certification with the Court within 90 days of an order to seal the records that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, all references that identify the movant as having been arrested, prosecuted, or adjudicated have been sealed.</dd>

                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> Expressly allow the Clerk to maintain a record so long as the record is not retrievable by the identification of the movant; and</dd>

                <dt>k</dt>
                <dd> If it plainly appears from the face of the motion, any accompanying exhibits, affidavits, and documents, and the record of any prior proceedings in the case, that the movant is not eligible for relief or is not entitled to relief, the Family Court may dismiss or deny the motion.</dd>
            
                <dt>l</dt>
                <dd> If the motion is not dismissed or denied after initial review, the Family Court shall order the prosecutor to file a response to the motion.

                <dt>m</dt>
                <dd> Upon the filing of the prosecutor's response, the Family Court shall determine whether a hearing is required.</dd>

                <dd> The Family Court shall not be required to entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same movant regarding the same offenses or arrests unless the previous motion was dismissed or denied without prejudice.</dd>
            
                <dt>r</dt>
                <dd> An order dismissing, granting, or denying a motion for sealing is a final order for purposes of appeal.</dd>
            
                <dt>s</dt>
