<a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%20108-335'>Pub. L. 108-335</a>, in subsec. (b)(1), added at the end "Amounts in the Charter School Fund shall remain available until expended, and any amounts in the Fund remaining unobligated or unexpended at the end of a fiscal year shall not revert to the General Fund of the District of Columbia."; and in subsec.

D.C. Law 15-348, in subsec. (a)(2), rewrote subpar. (A) and repealed subpar. (B). Prior to amendment, subpar. (A) of subsec. (a)(2) read as follows:

"(A) Initial payment. --

"(i) $10,000,000, in the case of fiscal year 2002; or

"(ii) $5,000,000, in the case of fiscal year 2003 and each succeeding fiscal year.

"(3) Expenditures from fund. -- Amounts in the Charter School Fund shall be used to make payments during a fiscal year to any public charter school operating in the District of Columbia during the fiscal year whose total audited enrollment (including enrollment in special needs categories) exceeds the student enrollment which served as the basis for determining the school's annual payment under this chapter for the year.

"(4) Form of payment. -- Payments under this subsection shall be made by electronic funds transfer from the Charter School Fund to a bank designated by a public charter school.

"(5) Authorization of appropriations. -- There are authorized to be appropriated to the Chief Financial Officer of the District of Columbia such sums as may be necessary to carry out this subsection for each fiscal year."
