The act was approved on October 10, 1997.\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nSavings Provision: Section 118(d) of Pub. L. 106-61, 111 Stat. 1285, provided that on the effective date of § 118, any existing special salary rates authorized for members of the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division under § 5305 of title 5, United States Code (or any previous similar provision of law) and any special rates of pay or special pay adjustments under section 403, 404, or 405 of the Federal Law Enforcement Pay Reform Act of 1990 applicable to members of the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division shall be rendered inapplicable.\n\nDC CODE § 5-1304\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Aug. 15, 1950, 64 Stat. 447, ch. 715, § 1; Mar. 27, 1951, 65 Stat. 27, ch. 20, § 1; June 20, 1953, 67 Stat. 76, ch. 146, title IV, § 403; Aug. 4, 1955, 69 Stat. 491, ch. 549, § 1; Oct. 5, 1961, 75 Stat. 831, Pub.
