Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-269 rewrote the section which had read:

"(a) The Clerk shall issue the notice of withholding pursuant to § 46-211 unless the obligor files an objection to contest the withholding pursuant to this section within 15 days after the notice of intent to withhold is mailed.

"(b) The notice to the holder pursuant to § 46-211 shall be sent within 45 days of the date that the notice of intent to withhold was sent to the obligor pursuant to subsection (a) and this subsection. Any objections raised by the obligor shall be resolved within 45 days from the date that the notice of intent to withhold was sent.

"(c) The only grounds for objection by an obligor are mistakes of fact which are defined as:

"(1) The amount of arrears;

"(2) The identity of the obligor; and

"(3) Whether the amount to be withheld as a periodic payment exceeds the limits of 15 U.S.C. § 1673(b).

"(d) Payment of arrearages after the date of the application to the Clerk of the Court for the issuance of a notice of intent to withhold pursuant to subsection (b) of this section is not a defense to the withholding.

"(e)(1) Objections filed to contest the withholding shall be filed with the Court.

"(2) The Court shall order withholding in all cases except where the identity of the obligor is mistaken or where arrearages have never equaled 30 days of support payments, and shall notify the obligor.

"(3) The notice of withholding shall include the time period within which the withholding shall begin, and shall contain the information given to the holder pursuant to § 46-211.

"(4) The Court shall not grant any request to stay implementation of withholding pending further objections or appeal.

"(5) If the Court determines that the amount to be withheld as a periodic payment exceeds the limits of 15 U.S.C. § 1673(b), then the Court shall issue a notice of withholding to the holder that complies with those limits.

"(f) Notice to an obligor sent pursuant to § 46-222 shall comply with this section and provisions in § 46-222(a)(3)."

Upon the filing of a motion to quash the withholding, the Collection and Disbursement Unit shall hold in escrow all monies collected pursuant to the withholding until the motion is resolved or the Court orders the release of the escrow.

"(b) The Court shall resolve any motion to quash the withholding within 90 days of the date the notice of withholding was mailed, unless, upon a showing of good cause, the Court finds that additional time is needed to resolve the motion. If the Court finds that additional time is needed to resolve the motion, the Court may release to the obligee any funds held in escrow pursuant to the withholding and order the release of all further payments to the obligee pending further proceedings.

"(e)(1) Motions filed to contest the withholding shall be filed with the Court.
