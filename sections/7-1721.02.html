Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 18-189 rewrote subsecs. (a), (b), and (e)(1); and added subsec. (f). Prior to amendment, subsecs. (a), (b), and (e)(1) read as follows:

"(a) No person shall sell, give, or furnish any cigarette or other tobacco product to any person under 18 years of age.

"(b) Any person who sells any cigarette or other tobacco product who has reasonable cause to believe that a person who attempts to purchase the product is under 18 years of age shall require that the purchaser present identification that indicates his or her age."

The United States Surgeon General has issued a warning that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy."

D.C. Law 19-171, in subsec. (f), substituted "section 1004 of Title 1 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (1 DCMR § 1004)" for "<a href='./1-1004.html'>section 1- 1004</a> of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations".
