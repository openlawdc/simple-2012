                <dd> Estimated requirements cover the period of the contract and are reasonably firm and continuing; and</dd>

Unless otherwise provided for in the contract, the effect of termination shall be to discharge both the District and the contractor from future performance of the contract, but not from their existing obligations. The contractor shall be reimbursed for the reasonable value of any nonrecurring costs incurred but not amortized in the price of the goods or services delivered under the contract.</dd>
