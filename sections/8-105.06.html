Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-91, in subsec. (l), substituted "promulgated by WASA." for "promulgated by WASA; and".

D.C. Law 18-256 rewrote subsecs. (b) and (m); in subsec. (c), substituted "National standard" for "national standard"; repealed subsec. (e); and added subsec. (m). Prior to amendment or repeal, subsecs. (b), (e), and (m) read as follows:

"(b) All users shall comply with the following standards which set forth prohibited discharges:

"(1) General prohibitions. -- A user shall not introduce into the District's wastewater system any pollutant which causes pass through or interference. This general prohibition applies to any user introducing pollutants into the District's wastewater system whether or not the user is subject to National Pretreatment Standards or national, state or local pretreatment requirements;

"(2) Specific prohibitions. -- In addition, the following pollutants shall not be introduced into the District's wastewater system:

"(A) Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the District's wastewater system, including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Centigrade using test methods specified in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Part 261.21. This prohibition includes any liquids, solids, or gases, which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to create fire or explosion or to injure in any other way the wastewater system or the process or operation and maintenance of the wastewater system. Prohibited materials under this section include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides, and sulfides.

"(B) Pollutants which have any corrosive property capable of damaging or creating a hazard to structures, equipment, processes and personnel of the District's wastewater system, including, but not limited to, discharges with pH (that is, a base 10 logarithm of the reciprocal of the concentration of hydrogen ions stated in grams per liter) of less than 5, or greater than 10.

"(C) Solid or viscous substances with a specific gravity greater than 2.50, or having any linear dimension greater than 1 inch, or which will or may cause, or contribute to obstruction of the flow in a sewer or otherwise interfere with the operation of the wastewater system including, but not limited to, grease, incompletely shredded garbage, animal remains, blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, spent grains, waste paper, wood, plastic, gas, tar, asphalt residue, residues from refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding, or polishing wastes.

"(D) Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants, released in discharge at a flow rate, or concentration, or a combination of both, which causes interference with the District's wastewater system.

"(E) Any wastewater with heat in such amounts as will inhibit the biological activity of processes in the District's wastewater system resulting in interference. In no case shall wastewater be discharged by a user in temperatures in excess of 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Centigrade, nor shall wastewater be discharged which causes individually or in combination with other wastewater, the influent at the District's wastewater treatment plant to have a temperature exceeding 104 degrees Fahrenheit or 40 degrees Centigrade.

"(F) Any wastewater containing petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause pass through or interference.

"(G) Any wastewater containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures above 32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Centigrade.

"(H) Any wastewater containing pollutants which result in the presence of toxic, noxious or malodorous liquids, solids or gases, which alone or in interaction with other wastes, are capable of creating a public nuisance or hazard to humans or animals, or are sufficient to inhibit access of District personnel to any part of the District's wastewater system, or cause interference or pass through.

"(I) Any wastewater of objectionable color or tint not removed in the treatment process, including, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning wastes.

"(J) Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by WASA."

"(e) Disposal of radioactive wastes shall comply with the regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, promulgated March 17, 1965 (31 Fed. R. 4502; 10 CFR, ch. 1)."

"(m) All users shall notify WASA, the Mayor, the Director of EPA's Region III Waste Management Division, and the appropriate city and state hazardous waste authorities in the jurisdiction in which the discharge emanated, in writing, of any discharge into the District's wastewater system of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under applicable federal, state and municipal regulations. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge."
