Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-28 rewrote subsec. (a) which had read as follows:

"(a) The oldest adult member of each class shall have prior claim of the human remains over the others in the same class, as follows: Spouse, adult child, father, mother, adult brother, adult sister, adult grandchild, adult nephew or niece, paternal grandparent, maternal grandparent, paternal uncle or aunt, maternal uncle or aunt, adult child of paternal uncle or aunt or adult child of maternal uncle or aunt, paternal great-grandparent, maternal great-grandparent, brother or sister of paternal grandparent, brother or sister of maternal grandparent, kindred of the spouse of the deceased in accordance with the preceding order of priority, or any adult friend or volunteer."

D.C. Law 17-145, in subsec. (e), substituted " subchapter II-A of Chapter 15 of Title 7" for "subchapter II of Chapter 15 of Title 7".

D.C. Law 17-353 validated a previously made technical correction in subsec. (e).
