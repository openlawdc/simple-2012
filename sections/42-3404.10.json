The tenants may respond to an owner's offer first jointly, then severally. Upon receipt of a written offer of sale from the owner that includes a description of the tenant's rights and obligations under this section, a group of tenants acting jointly shall have 15 days to provide the owner and the Mayor with a written statement of interest. Following that time period, if the tenants acting jointly have failed to submit a written statement of interest, an individual tenant shall have 7 days to provide a statement of interest to the owner and the Mayor.

(A) Upon receipt of a letter of intent from a tenant or a tenant group, the owner shall afford the tenants a reasonable period to negotiate a contract of sale, and shall not require less than 90 days. For every day of delay in providing information by the owner as required by this subchapter, the negotiation period is extended by 1 day. If more than 1 individual tenant submits a written statement of interest, the owner shall negotiate with each tenant separately, or jointly if the tenants agree to negotiate jointly.\n\n\"(B) If, at the end of the 90-day period or any extensions thereof, the tenants jointly have not contracted with the owner, the owner shall provide an additional 30-day period, during which any 1 of the current tenants may contract with the owner for the purchase of the accommodation;\n\n\"(C) If the owner is required to negotiate with more than 1 tenant pursuant to this section, the owner may decide which contract is more favorable without liability to the other tenants.\"\n\nDC CODE § 42-3404.10\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Sept. 10, 1980, D.C.
