"(2) The Mayor or his or her designee shall provide a written decision on the reconsideration request within 30 days of receipt of the request. If the Mayor or his or her designee fails to make a written reconsideration decision within this period, the claim shall be deemed accepted, and payment of compensation to the claimant shall commence on the 31st day following the date the request was filed. If the Mayor or his or her designee later makes an award against payment of compensation, payment shall cease immediately; provided, that the Mayor or his or her designee may only recoup benefits in accordance with § 1- 623.29, and not until all administrative remedies to the Department of Employment Service have been exhausted under subsection (b) of this section and § 1-623.28.
