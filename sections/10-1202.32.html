        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-144 repealed par. (2); rewrote par. (3); and, in par. (4), deleted "and for the expansion of the New Convention Center" from the end. Prior to amendment, pars. (2) and (3) read as follows:

"(2) The New Convention Center also needs to expand its meeting space and ballroom space on a site adjacent to or in close proximity to the New Convention Center.

"(3) The construction and development of the New Convention Center Hotel and the expansion of the New Convention Center would enable the Center to be more competitive in the convention market, attract increased business, provide for additional retail use, and enhance the financial viability of the Center. Expansion of the New Convention Center by the addition of meeting and ballroom space will also provide opportunity for private development within that space through the use of developable air space for residential uses."

D.C. Law 17-353, in the credit, renumbered the section designation from § 802 to § 232.
