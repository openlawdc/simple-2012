The priority consideration program shall also include provisions under which an employee described in subsection (a) of this section who has not been appointed to a Federal Bureau of Prisons law enforcement position and who applies for another Federal position in the competitive service shall receive priority consideration and may be given a competitive service appointment noncompetitively to such a competitive service position.

Such program shall terminate one year after the closing of the Lorton Correctional Complex.</dd>
