"(2) For soliciting agent, $50 for each company, renewal fee, $50 represented by such soliciting agent, or for each company represented by any policy-writing agent through which such soliciting agent solicits; provided, that no soliciting agent shall be required to pay for soliciting agents' licenses a sum in excess of $100 for any 1 licensing year;

"(3) For salaried company employee authorized to sign policies and to solicit insurance, $75, without regard to the number of companies represented by such salaried company employee;

"(4) For salaried company employee authorized to solicit but not authorized to sign policies, $50 for each company represented by said employee; provided, that the aggregation of such fees shall not exceed $100 for any 1 license year;

"(5) For nonresident or resident brokers, $100, with an annual fee of $100, except that the fee shall be $10 in case the applicant for a resident broker's license is subject also to the fee prescribed under paragraph (1) or (3) of this subsection;

"(6) For license to procure lines in unauthorized companies, $100, with an annual renewal fee of $100;

"(7) For new appointment fees, salaried company employees without broker privileges, a fee of $75; salaried company employees with broker privileges, a fee of $85, annual renewal fee of $85;

"(b) Under the license issued to any policy-writing agent or salaried company employee, or in the name of any firm, partnership, or corporation as provided under 31-2502.32, and for which license a fee has been paid in accordance with paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a), there may be added names of persons who are employed in or who actively function through the District office of the policy-writing agent, salaried company employee, or firm, partnership, or corporation, and who have company authority to sign but not to solicit policies. For such persons there shall be charged a fee of $2 per year for each company whose policies such person is authorized to sign.

"(c) Broker's licenses may be issued in the names of individuals, firms, partnerships, or corporations. In the case of firms, partnerships, or corporations, the authority to solicit shall extend only to the individuals who are designated in the license and in the application therefor as having authority to solicit, and there shall be charged for each such individual in excess of 2 an additional fee of $10.

"(d) Licenses to procure lines in unauthorized companies shall be issued in the names of individuals only.

"(e) The Mayor has the authority to amend all fees referred to in this chapter by way of rulemaking. The proposed rules shall be submitted to the Council for a 45-day period of review, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days of Council recess. If the Council does not approve or disapprove the proposed rules, in whole or in part, by resolution within the 45-day review period, the proposed rules shall be deemed approved.
