Sections 505, 506, 507, and 508 of Title 23, United States Code, referred to at the end of this section, related to relocation payments and assistance, and were a part of Chapter 5 of Title 23. That chapter was repealed January 2, 1971, by § 220(a)(10) of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, <a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%2091-646'>Pub.

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, § 711 (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.11.html'>§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.14.html'>§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.
