If the Court finds that additional time is needed to resolve the motion, the Court may release to the obligee any funds held in escrow pursuant to the withholding and order the release of all further payments to the obligee pending further proceedings.\n\n\"(c) The only grounds for objection by an obligor are mistakes of fact which are defined as:\n\n\"(1) The amount of arrears;\n\n\"(2) The identity of the obligor; and\n\n\"(3) Whether the amount to be withheld as a periodic payment exceeds the limits of 15 U.S.C. § 1673(b).\n\n\"(d) Payment of arrearages after the date of the issuance of a notice of withholding pursuant to § 46-209 is not a defense to the withholding.\n\n\"(e)(1) Motions filed to contest the withholding shall be filed with the Court.\n\n\"(2) The Court shall deny the motion in all cases except where the identity of the obligor is mistaken or where arrearages have never equaled one month of support payments, and shall notify the obligor.\n\n\"(3) Repealed.\n\n\"(4) The Court shall not grant any request to stay implementation of withholding or hold funds in escrow pending further objections or appeal.\n\n\"(5) If the Court determines that the amount to be withheld as a periodic payment exceeds the limits of 15 U.S.C. § 1673(b), the Court shall issue a notice to withhold to the holder that complies with those limits.\n\n\"(f) Repealed.\"\n\nTemporary Amendments of Section\n\nFor temporary (225 day) amendment of section, see § 7(j) of Child Support and Welfare Reform Compliance Temporary Amendment Act of 1998 (D.C.
