                <dd> The use of a combined report does not disregard the separate identities of the taxpayer members of the combined group. Each taxpayer member is responsible for tax based on its taxable income or loss apportioned or allocated to the District, which shall include, in addition to other types of income, the taxpayer member's apportioned share of business income of the combined group, where business income of the combined group is calculated as a summation of the individual net business incomes of all members of the combined group. A member's net business income is determined by removing all but business income, expense, and loss from that member's total income, as provided in this section and <a href='./47-1810.05.html'>§ 47-1810.05</a>.</dd>

                <dd> Share of any business income apportionable to the District of each of the combined groups of which it is a member, as determined under subsection (c) of this section;</dd>

                <dd> Share of any business income apportionable to the District of a distinct business activity conducted within and outside the District wholly by the taxpayer member, as determined under the provisions for apportionment of business income set forth in this chapter;</dd>

                <dd> Income sourced to the District from the sale or exchange of capital or assets, and from involuntary conversions, as determined under <a href='./47-1810.05.html'>§ 47- 1810.05(b)(8)</a>;</dd>

                <dd> If the taxable income computed pursuant to this section and <a href='./47-1810.05.html'>§ 47-1810.05</a> results in a loss for a taxpayer member of the combined group, that taxpayer member has a District net operating loss, subject to the net operating loss limitations and carryover provisions of this chapter. The District net operating loss shall be applied as a deduction in a prior or subsequent year only if that taxpayer has District source positive net income, whether or not the taxpayer is or was a member of a combined reporting group in the prior or subsequent year.</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> Except where otherwise provided, no tax credit or post-apportionment deduction earned by one member of the group, but not fully used by or allowed to that member, may be used, in whole or in part, by another member of the group or applied, in whole or in part, against the total income of the combined group. A post-apportionment deduction carried over into a subsequent year as to the member that incurred it, and available as a deduction to that member in a subsequent year, will be considered in the computation of the income of that member in the subsequent year regardless of the composition of that income as apportioned, allocated, or wholly within the District.</dd>
