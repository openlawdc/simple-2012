D.C. Law 16-79, in subsec. (a), substituted "divorce or legal separation is granted, or when a termination of a domestic partnership becomes effective under <a href='./32-702.html'>§ 32-702</a> and one partner has filed a petition for relief under this section," for "divorce or legal separation is granted,"; in par. (d)(3), substituted "marriage or domestic partnership" for "marriage"; in par. (d)(4), substituted "marriage or domestic partnership" for "marriage"; and in par. (d)(9)(B), substituted "both those that are the property of the marriage or domestic partnership and those that are not" for "both marital or non-marital".

D.C. Law 16-191, in subsec. (a), inserted "available" following "relief".

D.C. Law 17-231, in subsec. (a), substituted "<a href='./32-702.html'>§ 32-702(d)</a>" for "<a href='./32-702.html'>§ 32-702</a>".
