D.C. Law 18-370 rewrote the section, which formerly read:

"As used in this subchapter, the term:

"(1) 'Agency' means the highest organizational structure of the District of Columbia government at which budgeting data is aggregated.

"(2) 'Appropriated budget authority' means authorization by an act of the Congress that permits the District of Columbia government to incur obligations and make payments for specific purposes against funds included in the annual appropriations act for the District of Columbia.

"(2A) 'Budget category' includes control centers, responsibility centers, capital projects, capital sub-projects, and, in a performance-based agency, includes programs, activities, and object classes.

"(3) 'Control center' means the organizational authority subject to approval by Congress in the annual appropriations act for the District of Columbia.

"(4) 'Council' means the Council of the District of Columbia.

"(5) 'Gross-obligation budget' means budget authority from all sources of funding.

"(6) 'Non-appropriated budget authority' means the ability of the District of Columbia government to incur obligations and make payments for specified purposes against funds which are not subject to approval by the Congress in the annual appropriations act for the District of Columbia.

"(7) 'Non-offsetting' means an increase or decrease that occurs in the gross-obligation budget or in the appropriated budget authority.

"(8) 'Offsetting' means an increase that is matched by a decrease such that no change occurs in the gross-obligation budget or in the appropriated budget authority.

"(8A) 'Performance-based budgeting' shall have the same meaning as the term is defined in <a href='./47-308.01.html'>§ 47-308.01(a)</a>.

"(8B) 'Program' means the highest level, for budgeting and expenditure control, within an agency that the District of Columbia government uses for a specific purpose for appropriated budget authority, which may consist of multiple activities that combined, assist the program in achieving the stated purpose and goals.

"(9) 'Reprogramming' means any budget modification which results in an offsetting reallocation of funds from 1 budget category to another, for purposes other than those originally planned.

"(10) 'Responsibility center' means the organizational component below the control center level."
