        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-213, in the introductory paragraph, substituted "<a href='./47-1806.09f.html'>§ 47-1806.09f</a>" for "<a href='./4-1806.09f.html'>§ 4-1806.09f</a>"; and made a technical change in the enacting clause of D.C. Law 14-114, § 401(b), which resulted in no change in text.

D.C. Law 15-205 added a new sentence at the end of par. (1)(B); in par. (2), substituted "real property receiving the homestead deduction under <a href='./47-850.html'>§ 47-850</a> or a unit within a cooperative housing association for which the cooperative housing association is receiving the homestead deduction under <a href='./47-850.01.html'>§ 47-850.01</a>." for "Class 1 property as defined in <a href='./47-813.html'>§ 47-813(c-4)(1)</a>"; in par. (3), substituted "resident, as defined in <a href='./47-1801.04.html'>§ 47-1801.04(17)</a>" for "taxpayer, as defined in <a href='./47-1801.04.html'>§ 47-1801.04(7)</a>", and rewrote subpar. (A); and, in par. (4), substituted "means the total 'adjusted gross income,' as defined in <a href='./47-1803.02.html'>§ 47- 1803.02(b)</a>, of every member of the household" for "have the same meaning as 'household income' in <a href='./47-1806.06.html'>§ 47-1806.06(b)(2)</a>". Prior to amendment, subpar. (A) of par. (3) had read as follows:

"(A) Owns an eligible residence as his or her principal place of residence and has resided in the eligible residence for at least 7 years; and,".

D.C. Law 16-191, in par. (4), validated a previously made technical correction.
