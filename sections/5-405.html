                <dd> The Mayor of the District of Columbia is further authorized and directed to establish a workweek for officers and members of the Fire Department, other than those in the Firefighting Division, of 40 hours, and the hours of work in such workweek shall be performed on consecutive days in such workweek: Provided, that notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the Mayor of the District of Columbia or his designated agent or agents may, whenever the exigencies of the Fire Department require temporary or short-term services of 1 or more officers or members, order such officer, officers, member, or members to perform such services.</dd>

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, § 711 (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.11.html'>§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.14.html'>§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.
