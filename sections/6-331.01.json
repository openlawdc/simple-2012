Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nDelegation of Authority\n\nDelegation of Authority to the Director of the Office of Property Management to Provide Relocation Assistance to Persons and Businesses Displaced by the District of Columbia's Acquisition of Real Property through Condemnation by Eminent Domain or Threat Thereof, see Mayor's Order 2004-196, December 2, 2004 (51 DCR 11376).\n\nDC CODE § 6-331.01\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Oct. 6, 1964, 78 Stat. 1004, Pub.
