Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-283 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"<a href='./21-522.html'>§ 21-522</a>. Examination and admission to hospital; notice."

"Subject to the provisions of <a href='./21-523.html'>section 21-523</a>, the administrator of a private hospital, may, and the administrator of a public hospital shall, admit and detain for purposes of emergency observation and diagnosis a person with respect to whom application is made under <a href='./21-521.html'>section 21-521</a>, if the application is accompanied by a certificate of a psychiatrist or qualified psychologist on duty at the hospital stating that he has examined the person and is of the opinion that he has symptoms of a mental illness and, as a result thereof, is likely to injure himself or others unless he is immediately hospitalized. Not later than 24 hours after the admission pursuant to this subchapter of a person to a hospital, the administrator of the hospital shall serve notice of the admission, by registered mail, to the spouse, parent, or legal guardian of the person and to the Commission on Mental Health."
