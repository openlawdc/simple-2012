        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 19-168 rewrote subsec. (a), which formerly read:

"(a) The H Street N.E. Performance Parking Pilot Zone is designated as the area bounded by I Street, N.E., on the north, 15th Street, N.E., on the east, 3rd Street, N.E., on the west, and G Street, N.E., on the south, including both sides of these boundary streets."

D.C. Law 19-171, in the section heading, validated a previously made technical correction.
