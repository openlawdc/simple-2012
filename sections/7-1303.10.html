Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-199 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"§ 7-1303.10. Discharge from residential care.

"The Director shall discharge any resident admitted or committed pursuant to this subchapter if, in the judgment of the Chief Program Director, the results of a comprehensive evaluation, which shall be performed at least annually, indicate that residential care is no longer advisable. If the resident, the resident's parent or guardian, the resident's counsel, or the mental retardation advocate objects to the discharge, he or she may file a petition with the Court requesting a hearing in accordance with the procedures set forth in subchapter IV of this chapter. The resident shall not be discharged prior to the hearing."

D.C. Law 19-169, in subsec. (a), substituted "intellectual disability" for "mental retardation"; and, in subsec. (b), substituted "advocate for a person with an intellectual disability" for "mental retardation advocate".
