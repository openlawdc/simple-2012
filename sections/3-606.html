                <dd> The Commission shall have the power to make, amend, carry out, and enforce such rules as it deems necessary for and likely to be effective in governing the events and procedures within its jurisdiction as well as all participants in such events and procedures. The Commission shall conduct its rulemaking and enforcement and other functions under the provisions of Chapter 5 of Title 2 where appropriate, and shall promulgate rules within 60 days of its establishment.</dd>

                <dd> The Commission shall have the power to issue permits and licenses to all participants, and for all events covered by this chapter. If the Commission, by rule, regulation, or order requires a license for a person or event covered by this chapter, no person shall hold, conduct, or be a participant in any such boxing, wrestling, or martial arts contest, match, or exhibition without a permit or license from the Commission. The Commission is authorized, in its sole judgment and discretion, to assign to those with proper permits, dates on which boxing, wrestling, and martial arts contests, matches, and exhibitions may be held, and no person shall hold any boxing, wrestling, or martial arts contest, match, or exhibition on any dates unless specifically authorized to do so by the Commission. No permit as described in this section shall be issued to any person unless such person agrees to accord to the Commission the right to examine the books of account and other records of such person relative to the boxing, wrestling, or martial arts contest, match, or exhibition for which such permit is issued, and such permit shall so state on its face. Licenses and permits may be revoked or suspended by the Commission for violation of any rule, regulation, or order of the Commission or for violation of any rule, regulation, or order of the District of Columbia or for other cause. The contested case provisions of §<a href='./2-509.html'>§ 2-509</a> and 2-510 shall be followed in revocation and suspension proceedings.</dd>

Said bond shall be approved as to form and sufficiency of sureties by the Mayor, or by such official as he may designate. In case of default in such performance, recovery may be had on such bond in the same manner as other penalties are recovered by law.</dd>
            
                <dt>e</dt>
