(3)(A). Prior to amendment, par. (1) of subsec. (a) had read as follows:

"(a)(1) The elections of the officials referred to in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of <a href='./1-1001.01.html'>§ 1-1001.01</a>, and of officials designated pursuant to paragraph (4) of such section, and the primary under <a href='./1-1001.05.html'>§ 1-1001.05(b)</a> shall be held on the 1st Tuesday in May of each presidential election year."

(a)(3)(A), (B), (C), substituted "shall be held on the 1st Tuesday in April" for "shall be held on the 1st Tuesday after the 2nd Monday in September".
