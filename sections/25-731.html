        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>D.C. Law 13-298 amended and enacted into law Title 25 of the District of Columbia Official Code.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-361 repealed subsecs. (e), (f), and (g), which had read as follows:

"(e) The failure of a retailer who contracts to purchase an alcoholic beverage for full payment in cash on delivery to make full payment upon delivery shall constitute a violation of this chapter.

"(f) A retailer shall not satisfy the obligation to pay for an alcoholic beverage unless the payment is dated on or before the date payment is due and is, upon presentation, promptly honored by the bank on which it is drawn.

"(g) The failure of a manufacturer or wholesaler to deposit the payment in the manufacturer's or wholesaler's bank for credit or collection, or present the payment to the bank on which it is drawn, within 5 days from the receipt of a payment shall constitute a violation of this chapter. Each day that the failure continues shall constitute a separate violation."
