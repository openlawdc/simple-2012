                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> Applications for IDA shall be approved or disapproved by the Mayor with reasonable promptness.

                <dt>A</dt>
                <dd> Applies to the Social Security Administration for SSI benefits;</dd>

                <dd> The period of eligibility for IDA benefits shall end either at the end of the month in which the Social Security Administration makes a final decision on the application for SSI benefits, if the Social Security Administration's decision is a denial of the application, or at the end of the month in which the Social Security Administration begins payment of benefits, if the decision is favorable.</dd>
            
                <dt>C</dt>
                <dd> For purposes of this paragraph, the final decision of the Social Security Administration shall be the decision by the Appeals Council of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, or the denial by the Disability Determination Division or Administrative Law Judge, if the IDA recipient fails, without good cause, to file a timely appeal from that decision.</dd>
            
                <dt>D</dt>
                <dd> If the decision of the Administrative Law Judge is a denial and an appeal is filed timely, the Department of Human Services shall immediately make a determination whether to refer the IDA recipient for appropriate vocational rehabilitation services.</dd>
            
                <dt>E</dt>
                <dd> If an IDA recipient requests a fair hearing to contest the termination of his or her benefits, any IDA benefits paid pending the outcome of the fair hearing shall terminate as of the last month of the period of eligibility, as defined in this section, regardless of whether the fair hearing process is complete.</dd>
            
                <dt>4</dt>
                <dd> If an applicant for IDA has previously been determined by the Social Security Administration ("SSA") not to satisfy the disability requirements for SSI, DHS will evaluate disability in the same manner as under the Medicaid program, as provided in 42 C.F.R. §435.541. The applicant shall be ineligible for IDA unless he or she:</dd>
            
                <dt>A</dt>
                <dd> Alleges a disabling condition different from, or in addition to, that considered by SSA in making its determination;</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> Alleges more than 12 months after the most recent SSA determination denying disability that his or her condition has changed or deteriorated since that SSA determination, alleges a new period of disability which meets the durational requirements of the Social Security Act, and has not applied to SSA for a determination with respect to these allegations; or</dd>
            
                <dt>C</dt>
                <dd> Alleges less than 12 months after the most recent SSA determination denying disability that his or her condition has changed or deteriorated since that SSA determination, alleges a new period of disability which meets the durational requirements of the Social Security Act, and has applied to SSA for reconsideration or reopening of its disability decision.</dd>
            
                <dt>e</dt>
                <dd>(1) For any month or period of months in which an IDA recipient receives both IDA and SSI, the IDA recipient shall repay to the District of Columbia:</dd>
            
                <dt>A</dt>
                <dd> The entire amount of the IDA assistance payments received if the SSI benefits received for the same period equaled or exceeded the IDA payment; or</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> That portion of the IDA assistance payments equal in amount to the SSI benefits received for the same period if the SSI benefits received were less than the IDA payment.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> To make repayment in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection, an IDA applicant shall sign an Interim Assistance Reimbursement Authorization which:</dd>
            
                <dt>A</dt>
                <dd> Permits the Social Security Administration to send the individual's past-due SSI benefit payment to the DHS; and</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> Permits DHS to deduct from these payments an amount equal to the IDA benefits provided.</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> Upon receipt of an IDA recipient's past-due SSI benefit, DHS shall calculate, in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection, the amount of the benefit due to DHS as repayment and the amount, if any, due the IDA recipient. DHS shall then provide the IDA recipient with a written explanation of this calculation and shall pay any amount due the IDA recipient, in accordance with section 1631 of the Social Security Act, approved October 30, 1972 (<a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=86&page=1475'>86 Stat. 1475</a>; 42 U.S.C. § 1383(g)) and SSA Interim Assistance regulations, 20 C.F.R. §§ 416.1901 to 416.1922.</dd>
            
                <dt>4</dt>
                <dd> Because having a pending SSI application is an eligibility requirement for IDA, if an IDA recipient is determined by the Social Security Administration to meet the disability requirements for purposes of SSI eligibility but withdraws the SSI application prior to payment of past-due SSI benefits, the IDA benefits received by that individual shall be considered an overpayment and that individual shall be liable to the District for repayment of all IDA benefits received.</dd>
            
                <dt>e-1</dt>
                <dd>(1) The amount of a recipient's past-due SSI benefit payment that is due DHS as repayment under subsection (e) of this section shall be deposited into the Interim Disability Assistance Fund established by <a href='./4-204.09.html'>§ 4-204.09</a>.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> The amount of an overpayment of IDA benefits that is received from an IDA recipient pursuant to subsection (e)(4) of this section shall be deposited into the Interim Disability Assistance Fund established by <a href='./4-204.09.html'>§ 4-204.09</a>.</dd>
            
                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd> The Mayor shall submit to the Council by March 15 of each year a report on the operation of the program for the previous calendar year. The report shall include:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> The total number of IDA applicants, the number approved, and the number denied;</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> The number and percentage of IDA applicants approved for SSI. To the extent possible, the information should be provided for each of the four levels of adjudication (original application, reconsidered application, Administrative Law Judge decision, and Appeals Council of the Office of Hearings and Appeals;</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> An analysis of the approvals and denials at each level, why the approval percentage is what it is, and what needs to be done to ensure a better match between SSI approvals and DHS approvals; and</dd>

                <dd> Observations on the best practices in other states.</dd>

                <dd> The Department of Human Services shall establish eligibility criteria for participants in the Interim Disability Assistance program.</dd>
