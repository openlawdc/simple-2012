Legislative History of Laws

Law 12-75, the " Taxicab Commission Hearing Examiner Amendment Act of 1997," was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 12-253. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on November 4, 1997, and December 4, 1997, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on December 22, 1997, it was assigned Act No. 12-230 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 12-75 became effective on March 24, 1998.

Miscellaneous Notes

Law 19-184 amended this section only "upon the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan, as certified by the Chief Financial Officer to the Budget Director of the Council in a certification published by the Council in the District of Columbia Register." As of the most recent updated publication of this section, the certification required for Law 19-184 has not been made. Therefore the amendments have not been incorporated into this section.
