                <p>The Board may authorize the operation of bingo and raffles in the District of Columbia. Bingo means that form of gambling in which the winning chances are determined by a random drawing of a subset of numbered objects among a total set of 75 objects, consecutively numbered from 1 to 75; and the card, or cards, held by the player, which card or cards is or are sold, rented, or used only at the time of the gambling activity, and contains 5 rows of 5 spaces each, each space imprinted with a number between 1 and 75 inclusive, except the central space which is marked "FREE." For the purpose of this section, raffle is a lottery, other than that operated by the District of Columbia pursuant to this chapter, in which a prize is won by at least 1 of numerous persons buying chances.</p>
