They shall have the right to call witnesses and present evidence, and to cross-examine opposing witnesses. The presence of the respondent may be waived only if the Court finds that the respondent has knowingly and voluntarily waived his or her right to be present, or if the Court determines that the respondent is unable to be present by virtue of his or her physical disability.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., § 6-1946.\n\n1973 Ed., § 6-1673.\n\nEffect of Amendments\n\nD.C.
