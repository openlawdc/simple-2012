Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-269 rewrote subsec. (a);  substituted "Collection and Disbursement Unit" for "Court" in subsec. (b);  and added subsec. (e).   Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) had read:

"(a) A holder required to withhold earnings or other income shall withhold and make payment no later than the first pay period that occurs after 14 days following the date the notice was mailed or no later than the date the applicable income becomes due or otherwise available to the obligor. Thereafter, the holder shall send the required withholding to the Court on the same date the obligor is compensated."

D.C. Law 15-205, in subsec. (b), substituted "Court" for "Collection and Disbursement Unit".

D.C. Law 16-100 rewrote the section, which had read:

"(a) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, a holder required to withhold income shall withhold and make payment to the Collection and Disbursement Unit no later than 7 business days after the date the amount would have been paid or credited to the obligor. Thereafter, the holder shall send the required withholding to the Collection and Disbursement Unit on the same date that the obligor is compensated.

"(b) When the holder has received written notice of any legal proceedings challenging the withholding or the judgment or order of support on which it is based, the holder shall continue to withhold the payments from the obligor until receipt of a notice from the Court informing the holder to cease the withholding.
