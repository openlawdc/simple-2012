        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-354, in par. (3) of subsec. (g), validated previously made technical corrections.

D.C. Law 18-181, in subsec. (a), deleted "; and" from the end of par. (2), substituted "; and" for a period at the end of par. (3), and added par. (4); rewrote subsecs. (b), (c), (e), and (g)(2)(C); and added subsecs. (e-1) and (h). Prior to amendment, subsecs. (b), (c), (e), and (g)(2)(C) read as follows:

"(b) The aggregate cumulative amount of all Qualified Investments made by the Certified Capital Company following its Allocation Date will be considered in the calculation of the percentage requirements under this chapter. For purposes of satisfying the percentage requirements of subsection (a) of this section only, a Certified Capital Company that invests in a Qualified Business that certifies in an affidavit that at least 80% of its employees, at the time of the investment, are residents of the District shall be deemed to have invested $1.50 for every dollar actually so invested. Any proceeds received from a Qualified Investment may be invested in another Qualified Investment and shall count toward any requirement in this chapter with respect to investments of Certified Capital.

"(c) A Qualified Business at the time of first investment in the business by a Certified Capital Company shall remain classified as a Qualified Business. The business may receive additional investments from any Certified Capital Company if it continues to meet the qualifications for a Qualified Business and the additional investments shall be Qualified Investments; provided, that the Commissioner may waive one or more of the requirements for qualification as for a Qualified Business if the business was a Qualified Business at the time of the initial investment."

"(e) At its option, a Certified Capital Company, prior to making an investment in a specific business, may request from the Commissioner a written opinion that the business is a Qualified Business. Upon receiving the request, the Commissioner shall have 15 days to determine whether or not the business is a Qualified Business and notify the Certified Capital Company of its determination and an explanation. If the Commissioner fails to notify the Certified Capital Company with respect to the proposed investment within the 15-day period, the business shall be deemed to be a Qualified Business."

"(C) All Qualified Investments that the Certified Capital Company made during the previous calendar year."
