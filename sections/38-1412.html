"Secretary of Education" was substituted for "Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare" in subsection (a) of this section pursuant to § 301 of the Act of October 17, 1979, 93 Stat. 677, Pub. L. 96-88.

"Section 773 of the Public Health Service Act," referred to in subsection (b) of this subsection, was codified as 42 U.S.C. § 295f-3, and was repealed by the Act of October 12, 1976, 90 Stat. 2293, Pub. L. 94-484.

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.
