Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-306 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:

"Whoever, being at least 4 years older than a child, takes that child to any place, or entices, allures, or persuades a child to go to any place for the purpose of committing any offense set forth in §<a href='./22-3002.html'>§ 22-3002</a> to 22-3006 and §<a href='./22-3008.html'>§ 22- 3008</a> and 22-3009 shall be imprisoned for not more than 5 years and, in addition, may be fined in an amount not to exceed $50,000."

D.C. Law 17-353 validated a previously made technical correction in subsec. (a).
