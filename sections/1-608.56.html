Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-91, in subsec. (a), inserted "Notwithstanding subchapter XVII-A,".

Subsec. (110)(d)(1)(B) of D.C. Law 13-91 provides:

"(1) Subsection (a) is amended as follows:"

"(B)(i) Strike the phrase 'or reduction in grade,' and insert the phrase ' reduction in grade, or the placing of such attorney on enforced annual leave or enforced leave without pay,' in its place.

"(ii) The subparagraph shall apply upon the enactment of legislation by the United States Congress that states 'Notwithstanding any other law, section 3(c)(1)(B)(i) of the Legal Services Clarification and Technical Emergency Amendment Act of 1999, adopted by the Council of the District of Columbia is enacted into law.'"

<a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%20108-386'>Pub. L. 108-386</a>, in subsec. (a), substituted "reduction in grade, or the placing of such attorney on enforced annual leave or enforced leave without pay," for "or reduction in grade,".

D.C. Law 16-33 rewrote subsec. (b), which had read as follows:

"(b) The disciplinary action provided for in subsection (a) of this section shall be taken by:

"(1) The Corporation Counsel when the attorney is employed by the Office of the Corporation Counsel;

"(2) The Corporation Counsel, after consulting with the agency head, when the attorney is employed by a subordinate agency and there has been no delegation of authority over the attorney pursuant to <a href='./1-608.55.html'>§ 1-608.55</a>; or

"(3) The agency head or the Senior Executive Attorney designee when the attorney is employed by an independent agency or by a subordinate agency and the Corporation Counsel has delegated authority over the attorney to the subordinate agency head pursuant to <a href='./1-608.55.html'>§ 1-608.55</a>."

D.C. Law 16-91 added subsec. (d).

D.C. Law 16-191, in subsec. (b)(2), validated a previously made technical correction.
