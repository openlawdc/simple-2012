{"text":"A standard probate proceeding is a proceeding for the probate of a will or a determination of the decedent's intestacy, particularly when due execution of a will cannot be presumed under section 20-312, and for the appointment of a personal representative. This proceeding is instituted when an interested person or creditor files a petition for a standard probate proceeding with the Court in accordance with the provisions of section 20-304; and the filing of a complaint shall not be required for these purposes. This proceeding is conducted after notice as provided in section 20-323. If no petition for abbreviated or standard probate is filed within a reasonable time, the Register, with the approval of the Court, may file a petition for standard probate.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., § 20-321.\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nFor legislative history of D.C.
