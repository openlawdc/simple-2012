Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-38 rewrote this section which formerly required a law enforcement officer to take a student or child into custody and deliver him to the appropriate school and also provided for sealing records pertaining thereto.

D.C. Law 17-219 rewrote subsecs. (a)(1) and (2), which had read as follows:

"(a)(1) The District of Columbia Public Schools shall establish a truancy center in each ward of the District of Columbia for the delivery of truant public school and public charter school students by the Metropolitan Police Department.

"(2) A law enforcement officer shall take to the truancy center, in the ward where the student is found, any child who the law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe, based on the child's age and other factors, is truant from a public or public charter school on a day and during the hours when the public or public charter school is in session."
