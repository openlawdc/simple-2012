Before selecting or impaneling the jury, the court may cause a second, third, or other further list of prospective jurors to be drawn, certified and summoned in like manner. From the persons so certified and summoned, the court, after examination on oath and in open court as to their qualifications, shall select and impanel a jury of five capable and disinterested persons who have the qualifications of jurors as prescribed by law for the courts of the District of Columbia, and in addition thereto are not in the service or employment of the United States or of the District of Columbia.</p>
