Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-305, in subsec. (d), substituted "percentage increase in the local Consumer Price Index for all items" for "percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') for all items, in the Washington, D.C. Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area,".

D.C. Law 14-307 rewrote subsec. (a); and in subsec. (b), substituted "Class 1 Property" for "improved residential real property" in two different places. Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) had read as follows:

"(a) For the purpose of computing taxes on real property in the District of Columbia for the tax year beginning July 1, 1991, and ending June 30, 1992, and for each subsequent tax year, a cooperative housing association shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by <a href='./47-811.html'>§ 47-811</a>, if the improved residential real property owned by the cooperative housing association:
