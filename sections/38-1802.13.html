Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-9 rewrote subsec. (a); and, in subsec. (c)(5), substituted "eligible chartering authority" for "Board of Education". Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) read as follows:

"(a) Charter or law violations; failure to meet goals. --

"(1) In general. -- Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, an eligible chartering authority that has granted a charter to a public charter school may revoke the charter if the eligible chartering authority determines that the school:

"(A) Committed a violation of applicable laws or a material violation of the conditions, terms, standards, or procedures set forth in the charter, including violations relating to the education of children with disabilities; or

"(B) Failed to meet the goals and student academic achievement expectations set forth in the charter.

"(2) Special rule. -- An eligible chartering authority may not revoke a charter under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, except pursuant to a determination made through a review conducted under § 38-1802.12(a)(3)(B)."

D.C. Law 17-353 , in subsec. (a), substituted "established by the eligible chartering authority" for "established by the chartering authority".
