                <dd> If a protest is filed in a timely manner under subsection (a) of this section, the Mayor may not issue a final assessment of the deficiency, interest, or penalties, and the Office of Administrative Hearings shall decide, after providing an opportunity for a hearing, whether the deficiency, interest, or penalties are proper. Filing a protest shall be deemed to be an election that the Office of Administrative Hearings shall be the exclusive forum to adjudicate all challenges to the proposed assessment, and shall be deemed to be an irrevocable waiver of any right to adjudication of all such challenges in any other forum. Nothing in this subsection limits the right of any person to judicial review pursuant to <a href='./2-1831.16.html'>§ 2-1831.16</a>.</dd>

        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-217 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"(a) Unless otherwise provided in this title, before a final assessment of a deficiency, interest, and penalties against a person, the Mayor shall send the person a proposed assessment and provide the person, not less than 30 days after the proposed assessment is sent, with an opportunity to file a protest that explains why the deficiency, interest, and penalties should not be assessed. If a protest is filed in a timely manner, the Mayor shall grant the person a hearing if requested.

"(b) If the person fails to file a protest in a timely manner under subsection (a) of this section, or the Mayor determines after review of the protest or after a hearing granted under subsection (a) of this section, that the person is liable for a deficiency, interest, or penalties, the Mayor shall send the person a final assessment of the deficiency, interest, or penalties.

"(c) If the period of limitations will expire without adequate opportunity for assessment, the Mayor may issue a final assessment of a deficiency, interest, or penalties against a person under this title without first issuing a proposed assessment."
