                <dd> To determine that the presumption favoring parental custody has been rebutted, the court must find, by clear and convincing evidence, one or more of the following factors:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> That the parents have abandoned the child or are unwilling or unable to care for the child;</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> That custody with a parent is or would be detrimental to the physical or emotional well-being of the child; or</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> That exceptional circumstances, detailed in writing by the court, support rebuttal of the presumption favoring parental custody.</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> The court shall not consider a parent's lack of financial means in determining whether the presumption favoring parental custody has been rebutted.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> The court shall not use the fact that a parent has been the victim of an intrafamily offense against the parent in determining whether the presumption favoring parental custody has been rebutted.</dd>
            
                <dt>d</dt>
                <dd> If the court concludes that the parental presumption has not been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the court shall dismiss the third-party complaint and enter any appropriate judgment in favor of the parent. The court shall only address the factors set forth in <a href='./16-831.08.html'>§ 16-831.08</a> once the presumption favoring parental custody has been rebutted.</dd>
