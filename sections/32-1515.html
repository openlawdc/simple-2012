Thereafter compensation shall be paid in installments, biweekly, except where the Mayor determines that payment in installments should be made monthly or at some other period.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> Upon making the 1st payment and upon suspension of payment for any cause, the employer shall immediately notify the Mayor in accordance with a form prescribed by the Mayor that payment of compensation has begun or has been suspended, as the case may be.</dd>

                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd> If any compensation, payable under the terms of an award, is not paid within 10 days after it becomes due, there shall be added to such unpaid compensation an amount equal to 20% thereof, which shall be paid at the same time as, but in addition to, such compensation, unless review of the compensation order making such award is had as provided in <a href='./32-1522.html'>§ 32-1522</a> and an order staying payments has been issued by the Mayor or court. The Mayor may waive payment of the additional compensation after a showing by the employer that owing to conditions over which he had no control such installment could not be paid within the period prescribed for the payment.</dd>
            
                <dt>g</dt>
                <dd> Within 16 days after final payment of compensation has been made, the employer shall send to the Mayor a notice, in accordance with a form prescribed by the Mayor, stating that such final payment has been made, the total amount of compensation paid, the name of the employee and of any other person to whom compensation has been paid, the date of the injury or death, and the date to which compensation has been paid. If the employer fails to so notify the Mayor within such time the Mayor shall assess against such employer a civil penalty in the amount of $100.</dd>
            
                <dt>h</dt>
                <dd> The Mayor: (1) May upon his own initiative at any time in a case in which payments are being made without an award; and (2) shall in any case where right to compensation is controverted, or where payments of compensation have been stopped or suspended, upon receipt of notice from any person entitled to compensation or from the employer, that the right to compensation is controverted, or where payments of compensation have been stopped or suspended, make such investigations, cause such medical examinations to be made, or hold such hearings, and take such further action as he considers will properly protect the rights of all parties.</dd>
