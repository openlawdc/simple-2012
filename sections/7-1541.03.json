(b), substituted \" subchapter II-A of this chapter 15\" for \"subchapter II of this chapter 15\"; in subsec. (b)(6), substituted \"recovered, screened, tested, processed, stored, distributed, and transported\" for \"processed, preserved, stored, and transported\"; and, in subsec.

Law 17-353 validated a previously made technical correction in subsec. (b).\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nLaw 7-231, the \"Technical Amendments Act of 1988,\" was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 7-586, which was referred to the Committee of the Whole. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on November 29, 1988 and December 13, 1988, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on January 6, 1989, it was assigned Act No. 7-285 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review.\n\nFor Law 17-145, see notes following § 7-1501.01.\n\nFor Law 17-353, see notes following § 7-161.\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402(36) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nDC CODE § 7-1541.03\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Sept. 10, 1962, 76 Stat. 535, Pub.
