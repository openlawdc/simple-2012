        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Legislative History of Laws

Law 17-352, the "Bicycle Safety Enhancement Amendment Act of 2008", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 17-981 which was referred to the Committee on Public Works and the Environment. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on December 2, 2008, and December 16, 2008, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on January 15, 2009, it was assigned Act No. 17-686 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 17-352 became effective on March 25, 2009.

Miscellaneous Notes

Section 4 of D.C. Law 17-352 provides that section 2(a)(1)(C) shall apply upon inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan.

The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of February 15, 2012, that the fiscal effect of section 2(a)(1)(C) of Law 17-352 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 17-352, are not in effect.
