No material witness shall be detained because of inability to comply with any condition of release if the testimony of such witness can adequately be secured by deposition, and further detention is not necessary to prevent a failure of justice. Release may be delayed for a reasonable period of time until the deposition of the witness can be taken pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., § 23-1326.\n\n1973 Ed., § 23-1326.\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nLaw 7-104, the \"Technical Amendments Act of 1987,\" was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 7-346, which was referred to the Committee of the Whole.
