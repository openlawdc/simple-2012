        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-28 rewrote subsec. (d) which had read:

"(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, an insurer shall not make or permit a differential in ratings, premium payments, or dividends based on the sex, physical handicap, or disability of an applicant or policyholder unless there is actuarial justification for the differential."

D.C. Law 17-177, in subsec. (d), substituted "sexual orientation, gender identity or expression" for "sexual orientation".
