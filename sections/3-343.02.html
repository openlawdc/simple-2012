1981 Ed., § 2-343.2.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-169 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"Unless expressly authorized by the District of Columbia Sports Commission or its duly authorized agent, no person shall at any time enter onto any portion of the playing field within the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium. For the purposes of this section, the 'playing field' is that area encompassed by the seating facilities within the Stadium as such seating facilities may be arranged from time to time."

D.C. Law 18-111, in subsecs. (a) and (b), substituted "Washington Convention and Sports Authority" for "District of Columbia Sports and Entertainment Commission".
