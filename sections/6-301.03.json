The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on November 29, 1988, and December 13, 1988, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on January 6, 1989, it was assigned Act No. 7-285 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review.\n\nLaw 12-144, the \"National Capital Revitalization Corporation Act of 1998,\" was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 12-514, which was referred to the Committee on Economic Development. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on March 3, 1998 and April 7, 1998, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on May 5, 1998, it was assigned Act No. 12-355 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 12-144 became effective September 11, 1998.\n\nFor Law 14-188, see notes following § 6-301.02.\n\nFor Law 15-39, see notes following § 6-301.01.\n\nEffective Dates\n\nSection 33(b)(1) of D.C. Law 12-144 provided that § 31(a) shall take effect on the latter of: (A) September 11, 1998; or (B) the Dates determined by the Board, but not later than one year after the initial meeting of the Board.\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nCompensation for board members of Agency: Section 120(c) of Pub. L. 103-127, 107 Stat. 1346, the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 1994, provided that notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the Board of Directors of the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency shall be paid, during any fiscal year, a per diem compensation at a rate established by the Mayor.\n\nD.C. Law 14-188 repealed this section on a permanent basis. D.C. Law 15-39 also purported to repeal this section. The repeal by D.C. Law 15-39 was ineffective.\n\nDC CODE 6-301.03\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Aug. 2, 1946, 60 Stat. 793, ch. 736, § 4; Dec. 24, 1973, 87 Stat. 778, Pub.
