                <dd>(1) In case of failure to file a return required by this title on the date prescribed (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount required to be shown as tax on the return 5% of the amount of the tax if the failure is for not more than one month, with an additional 5% for each additional month or fraction thereof during which the failure continues, not exceeding 25% in the aggregate. The amount of tax required to be shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed on the return.</dd>

For purposes of computing the addition for a month, the amount of tax shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of the tax which is paid on or before the beginning of the month and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed on the return.</dd>

For the purpose of computing the addition for a month, the amount of tax stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the amount of the tax which is paid before the beginning of the month.</dd>
