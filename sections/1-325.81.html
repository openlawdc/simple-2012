        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 19-21, in subsec. (a), substituted "lapsing" for "nonlapsing"; and, in subsec. (c), substituted "be used exclusively for the purposes set forth in subsection (b) of this section. Any unexpended monies in the Fund at the end of a fiscal year shall revert to the unrestricted fund balance of the General Fund of the District of Columbia" for "shall not revert to the unrestricted fund balance of the General Fund of the District of Columbia at the end of a fiscal year, or at any other time, but shall be continually available for the uses and purposes set forth in subsection (b) of this section without regard to fiscal year limitation, subject to authorization by Congress".

D.C. Law 19-171, in subsec. (c), validated a previously made technical correction.
