                <dd>(1) A license that has not been revoked, suspended, or voluntarily relinquished and that has not been renewed by its expiration date shall be deemed to be lapsed.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 18-111 rewrote subsecs. (a), (b) and (c), which had read as follows:

"(a) The Department shall send notice of impending license expiration, an application for renewal, and a statement of the applicable renewal fee to each licensee not less than 30 days prior to the expiration date at the address shown on the current license, unless the licensee has notified the Department in writing of an address change, in which case the Department shall notify the licensee at the new address.

"(b) A license that has not been revoked, suspended, or voluntarily relinquished shall not lapse at the end of 2 years unless the District government has mailed timely notice of the expiration date and an application for renewal, and the licensee has either failed to file the renewal application or failed to pay the required renewal fee. A license shall continue in force until 30 days from the date notice of expiration and the application for renewal has been mailed to the licensee or 6 months from the expiration date, whichever shall occur first. If the licensee fails to notify the Department of a change of address of the business, the license shall lapse on the expiration date.

"(c)(1) Any licensee whose license has lapsed under this section may apply for renewal at any time within 6 months of the lapse, and shall be reinstated upon the payment of a fine of $150, in addition to all other applicable fees, plus whatever additional fines or fees are provided by law.

"(2) A licensee whose license has been expired for more than 6 months shall be treated as a new applicant and not as an applicant for renewal, unless otherwise provided by applicable law. If the new applicant conducted business at any time during the 6 months grace period without complying with the renewal procedures pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the applicant shall be deemed to have conducted business without a license and shall be liable for any and all fees and fines applicable to conducting business without a license. No new application for a license may be processed until all applicable fines and fees have been paid."
