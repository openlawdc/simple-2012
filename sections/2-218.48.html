        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-207 substituted "certified business enterprises" for "local, small, or disadvantaged businesses" in two places.

D.C. Law 18-141 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:

"The willful breach by a contractor of a subcontracting plan for utilization of certified business enterprises in the performance of a contract, the failure to submit any required subcontracting plan monitoring or compliance report, or the deliberate submission of falsified data may be enforced by the Department through the imposition of penalties, including monetary fines of $15,000 or 5% of the total amount of the work that the contractor was to subcontract to certified business enterprises, whichever is greater, for each such breach, failure, or falsified submission."

D.C. Law 18-159, in subsec. (a), deleted "or" from the end of par. (1), rewrote par. (2), and added par. (3). Prior to amendment, subsec. (a)(2) read as follows:

"(2) Submits a monitoring or compliance report with the intent to defraud, by means of a false statement, failure to disclose information, or other fraudulent scheme or device."
