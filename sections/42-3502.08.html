Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-145 substituted "rent charged" for "rent ceiling"; and rewrote subsecs. (g) and (h), which had read as follows:

"(g) No adjustments in rent under this chapter may be implemented until a full 180 days have elapsed since any prior adjustment.

"(h)(1) One year from March 16, 1993, unless otherwise ordered by the Rent Administrator, each adjustment in rent charged permitted by this section may implement not more than 1 authorized and previously unimplemented rent charged adjustment. If the difference between the rent charged and the rent charged for the rental unit consists of all or a portion of 1 previously unimplemented rent charged adjustment, the housing provider may elect to implement all or a portion of the difference.

"(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent a housing provider, at his or her election, from delaying the implementation of any rent charged adjustment, or from implementing less than the full amount of any rent charged adjustment. A rent charged adjustment, or portion thereof, which remains unimplemented shall not expire and shall not be deemed forfeited or otherwise diminished."
