{"text":"","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., ยง 35-1102.1.\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nLaw 11-241, the \"Newborn Health Insurance Amendment Act of 1996,\" was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 11-, which was referred to the Committee on Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on November 7, 1996, and December 3, 1996, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on December 24, 1996, it was assigned Act No. 11-501 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 11-241 became effective on April 9, 1997.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nPurpose of Law 11-241: Section 2 of D.C. Law 11-241 provided that:\n\n\"(a) The Council of the District of Columbia finds that:\n\n(1) Phenylketonuria (\"PKU\") is a cause of severe mental retardation that can be prevented if diagnosed within the first 3 weeks of childbirth.\n\n(2) The District's statutes and regulations direct the screening of newborn infants for hereditary and congenital disorders in the hospital prior to discharge.\n\n(3) Hospital stays of less than 24 hours after childbirth typically result in unsatisfactory PKU specimens as a result of insufficient milk feedings.\n\n(4) Insurers, both indemnity and managed care plans, have implemented benefit plans covering no more than 24 hours of postpartum stay in a hospital, despite little or no scientific support for the efficacy of this policy for the general population.\n\n(5) The Guidelines for Perinatal Care, prepared by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, recommends a hospital stay of at least 48 hours after childbirth.\n\n(b) In the interest of maximizing the prevention of mental retardation from PKU and other hereditary and congenital disorders, the Council of the District of Columbia hereby establishes a policy to require all individual and group health insurance policies to provide coverage for a minimum hospital stay for a mother and child following the birth of a child.\"\n\nDC CODE ยง 31-3802.01\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Oct. 20, 1979, D.C.
