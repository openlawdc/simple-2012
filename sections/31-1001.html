Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-191 repealed subsec. (d) providing:

"(d) All reports obtained by or disclosed to the Commissioner pursuant to this chapter shall be given confidential treatment and shall not be subject to subpoena, shall not be subject to disclosure under subchapter II of Chapter 15 of Title 1 [1981 Ed.], and shall not be made public by the Commissioner, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or any other person except to insurance departments of other states, without the prior written consent of the insurer to which it pertains, unless the Commissioner, after giving the insurer who would be affected notice and an opportunity to be heard, determines that the interest of policyholders, shareholders, or the public will be served by the publication thereof, in which event the Commissioner may publish all or any part in the manner the Commissioner may deem appropriate."

D.C. Law 15-354, in subsec. (a), substituted "of the Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking" for "of Insurance and Securities".
