Law 17-66, the "Housing Support for Teachers Act of 2007", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 17-95 which was referred to the Committee on Housing and Urban Affairs. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on July 10, 2007, and October 2, 2007, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on October 26, 2007, it was assigned Act No. 17-171 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 17-66 became effective on December 21, 2007.

Miscellaneous Notes

Section 10 of D.C. Law 17-66 provides that this act shall apply upon the inclusion of its fiscal effect in a Congressional appropriations act.

The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of February 15, 2012, that the fiscal effect of Law 17-66 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 17-66, are not in effect.
