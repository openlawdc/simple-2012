Act 15-10, January 27, 2003, 50 DCR 1481).\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402(93) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nNew implementing regulations: Pursuant to this section, the following new regulations were adopted in 1982: The \"Police Officers Outside Employment Act of 1982\" (D.C. Law 4-132, July 24, 1982, 29 DCR 2450).\n\nOffice of Major and Superintendent of Police abolished: See Historical and Statutory Notes following § 5-105.01.\n\nDelegation of Personnel Authority in the Metropolitan Police Department to the Chief of Police: See Mayor's Order 97-88, May 9, 1997 (44 DCR 2959).\n\nDC CODE § 5-127.01\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Feb. 28, 1901, 31 Stat. 819, ch. 623, § 1; June 8, 1906, 34 Stat. 221, ch. 3056.)","sections":[],"division":{"identifier":"I","text":"Government of District."},"title":{"identifier":"5","text":"Police, Firefighters, Medical Examiner, and Forensic Sciences.
