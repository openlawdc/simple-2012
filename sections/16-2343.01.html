Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-269 rewrote subsec. (e) which formerly read:

"(e) A conclusive presumption of paternity shall be created upon a genetic test result and an affidavit from a laboratory, certified by the American Association of Blood Banks, that indicates a 99% probability that the putative father is the father of the child and the Division shall enter a judgment finding the parentage of the child."

; and added subsec. (f).

D.C. Law 18-33 rewrote subsec. (e), which had read as follows:

"(e) A genetic test result that indicates a 99% probability that the putative father is the father of the child shall create a conclusive presumption of paternity if the genetic test is of a type generally acknowledged as reliable by accreditation bodies designated by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and is performed by a laboratory approved by such a body. The Court shall enter a judgment finding the parentage of the child consistent with such result, upon the submission of the result and a certifying affidavit from the laboratory, subject to the determination of any objection properly filed pursuant to subsection (b) of this section."
