(g), rewrote par. (1), and in par. (2), substituted \"The public hearing referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be held within 120 days after the statement required by subsections (a) and (b) of this section is filed, and at least 20-days notice shall be given by the Mayor to the person filing the statement; provided, that the Mayor may extend the 120-day period if all parties consent to the extension.\" for \"The public hearing referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be held within 30 days after the statement required by subsections (a) and (b) of this section is filed, and at least 20-days notice shall be given by the Mayor to the person filing the statement.\", substituted \"The Mayor shall make a determination within 120 days after the conclusion of the hearing; provided, that the Mayor may extend this period if all parties consent to the extension.\" for \"The Mayor shall make a determination within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing.\", and substituted \"and any party\" for \"any person to whom notice of hearing was sent, and any other person whose interest may be affected\". Prior to amendment, par. (1) of subsec. (g) had read as follows:\n\n\"(g)(1) The Mayor shall approve any merger or other acquisition of control referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section unless, after a public hearing, the Mayor finds that:\n\n\"(A) After the change of control, the domestic insurer referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed;\n\n\"(B) The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in the District or tend to create a monopoly. In applying the competitive standard in this paragraph:\n\n\"(i) The informational requirements of § 31-704(c)(1) and the standards of § 31-704(d)(2) shall apply;\n\n\"(ii) The merger or other acquisition shall not be disapproved if the Mayor finds that any of the situations meeting the criteria provided by § 31- 704(d)(3) exist; and\n\n\"(iii) The Mayor may condition the approval of the merger or other acquisition on the removal of the basis of disapproval within a specified period of time;\n\n\"(C) The financial condition of any acquiring party is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer, or prejudice the interest of its policyholders;\n\n\"(D) The plans or proposals which the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets, or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest;\n\n\"(E) The competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control; or\n\n\"(F) The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance buying public.\"\n\nTemporary Amendments of Section\n\nFor temporary (225 day) amendment of section, see § 2 of Department of Insurance and Securities Regulation Procurement Temporary Act of 2002 (D.C.
