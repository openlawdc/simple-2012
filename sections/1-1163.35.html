                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> A civil penalty shall be assessed by the Elections Board by order only after the person charged with a violation has been given an opportunity for a hearing, and the Elections Board has determined, by decision incorporating its findings of facts, that a violation did occur, and the amount of the penalty. Any hearing under this section shall be of record and shall be held in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 2.</dd>

                <dd> If the person against whom a civil penalty is assessed fails to pay the penalty, the Elections Board shall file a petition for enforcement of its order assessing the penalty in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The petition shall designate the person against whom the order is sought to be enforced as the respondent. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith sent by registered or certified mail to the respondent and his attorney of record, and if the respondent is a political, exploratory, inaugural, transition, or legal defense committee, to the chairman of the committee, and then the Elections Board shall certify and file in court the record upon which the order sought to be enforced was issued. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside, in whole or in part, the order and the decision of the Elections Board or it may remand the proceedings to the Elections Board for further action as it may direct. The court may determine de novo all issues of law, but the Election Board's findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.</dd>
