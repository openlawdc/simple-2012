                <p>The Council shall develop and submit to the Mayor a single unified workplace plan that outlines a 5-year strategy, with quantitative goals, for the statewide workforce investment system for the District of Columbia in accordance with section 112 of the Federal Act. Upon the Mayor's approval of the state plan, the Mayor shall transmit the State Unified Workforce Plan to the Council of the District of Columbia for a 10-day period of review, excluding days of Council of the District of Columbia recess. If the Council of the District of Columbia does not approve or disapprove the State Unified Workforce Plan by resolution within the 10-day review period, the State Unified Workforce Plan shall be deemed approved. Within 2 years of July 18, 2000, the Unified Workforce Plan shall be amended to also encompass services provided to the Welfare to Work and TANF implementing laws.</p>
