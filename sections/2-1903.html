                <dd> A communication-impaired person entitled to an interpreter under this chapter shall, if practicable, notify the appropriate appointing authority of the person's need for an interpreter at least 5 business days prior to the person's appearance. A failure to notify the appointing authority of the need for an interpreter is not a waiver of the right to an interpreter.</dd>

                <dd> An appointing authority, when it knows a communication-impaired person is, or will be coming before it, shall inform the communication-impaired person of the right to a qualified interpreter. In a judicial proceeding, when the court knows that a communication-impaired person will be before it, the court shall inform the party, or the parent of a juvenile who is a party, of the right of any communication-impaired person to a qualified interpreter.</dd>
