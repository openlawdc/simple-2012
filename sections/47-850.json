In order to obtain the deduction provided under this subsection, the owner shall complete the affidavit and return it to the Mayor within 60 days of the date such affidavit form was mailed to the owner.

If such application is mailed to the Department, the Department shall mail a receipt to the real property owner so filing; provided, that the real property owner so filing encloses a stamped self-addressed envelope with his application.\n\n\"(3), (4) [Repealed].\n\n\"(d)(1) For the purpose of computing taxes on real property in the District of Columbia for the tax year commencing July 1, 1977, the Mayor shall deduct from the estimated market value of residential real property owned by a cooperative housing association and occupied by the members of such association the amount of 12% of the estimated market value of said property; provided, however, that the deduction may not exceed the amount of $6,000 multiplied by the number of dwelling units which are the principal place of residence of members of such association.\n\n\"(2) For the purpose of computing taxes on real property in the District of Columbia for the tax year commencing July 1, 1978, and for each year thereafter, the Mayor shall deduct from the estimated market value of residential real property owned by a cooperative housing association and occupied by the shareholders or members of such association the amount of 60% of the estimated market value of said property; provided, however, that the deduction may not exceed the amount of $9,000 or, commencing with that portion of tax year beginning July 1, 1986, that occurs after January 1, 1987, the amount of $15,000 or, commencing with the tax year beginning July 1, 1988, the amount of $22,000 or, commencing with the tax year beginning July 1, 1990, the amount of $30,000 multiplied by the number of dwelling units which are occupied by the shareholders or members of such association.\n\n\"(3) [Repealed].\n\n\"(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, for the tax year commencing July 1, 1977 only, tax bills relating to residential real property owned by cooperative housing associations shall not reflect the deduction from estimated market value provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection. Such tax bills shall be paid in the full amount shown thereon at the times provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection. The amount of the deduction shall be determined by the Mayor at the earliest practicable time after receipt of the required affidavits and shall be refunded to the owners of such property, such refunds to be made from current real property tax revenues.\n\n\"(e)(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, applications shall be filed by September 1st preceding any tax year. To obtain the deduction provided for under subsections (c)(1) and (d)(2) of this section owners of eligible property shall properly complete and file an application as prescribed by the Mayor. To obtain the deduction and to determine the occupancy of eligible property as described in subsection (d)(2) of this section each shareholder or member of the cooperative housing association shall (in such manner and at such time as the Mayor shall prescribe) complete and return the application herein provided for. The Mayor may require the officers or managers of each cooperative housing association to distribute the applications to its shareholders or members and to collect the completed applications from such shareholders or members for return to the Mayor. Officers or managers of each cooperative housing association shall supply such other information as the Mayor may require.\n\n\"(B) The Mayor may verify the contents of the applications. If any person, corporation, or association shall willfully make a false statement concerning any information required to be supplied on such application, such person, corporation, or association shall be deemed guilty of perjury, and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to the penalties for that offense provided for by § 22-2405. Upon written request by the owner of eligible property, the Mayor may grant a reasonable extension of time for filing the application, not to exceed 30 days.\n\n\"(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, effective October 1, 1993, and for each tax year thereafter, the Mayor, upon written request by the owner of eligible real property, may grant a reasonable extension of time for filing the application for the homestead deduction required to be filed under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, when in the Mayor's judgment good cause exists for the extension. Any written request for an extension of the filing deadline of the application for the homestead deduction shall only be considered for the tax year in which it is submitted. If an extension is granted, the property tax liability shall be adjusted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Mayor.\n\n\"(2) Applications filed by June 1st shall apply for the tax year beginning on October 1st following the date of application and for succeeding tax years until the tax year for which quinquennial filing of the application is required pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection; provided, that the property remains eligible for the deduction. Eligibility for the deduction shall be determined according to the actual use of the property on the first day of each tax year. Property eligible for the deduction on the first day of any tax year shall remain eligible for the entire tax year. Where there is a change in ownership of residential real property after September 1st but before the beginning of the new tax year on October 1st, the new owner shall immediately notify the Mayor of the change in ownership and, to obtain the homestead deduction, shall file a properly completed application by October 15th. This paragraph shall apply to real property tax year 1994 and quinquennial filings shall be filed by September 1st preceding any tax year.\n\n\"(2A) The eligibility of any real property for the deduction provided for in this section shall not be affected by the transfer of the real property into a revocable trust, so long as the transfer is without consideration and the property remains the principal residence of the transferor before and after the transfer.\n\n\"(3) Commencing with the tax year beginning July 1, 1981, and ending June 30, 1982, the Mayor, in order to implement this subsection, shall mail every 5 years, on or before July 1st, an application to the owners of real property eligible for the deduction. Failure of the Mayor to mail an application to an owner of residential real property eligible for the deduction provided for under this section shall in no manner diminish the obligation of the owner to secure and file, in a timely manner, an application in order to obtain the deduction. Each homeowner eligible for the relief provided under this section or § 47-863 shall be required to file an application for the tax relief for the quinquennial filing period on or before September 1st for the tax year beginning October 1st.\n\n\"(4) Any application properly completed and timely filed for the tax year beginning July 1, 1981 and ending June 30, 1982, shall also apply to succeeding tax years until the tax year for which quinquennial filing of the application is required pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection. Any residential real property which obtains the deduction provided for under this section, for the tax year beginning July 1, 1981, and ending June 30, 1982 shall obtain the deduction for each succeeding tax year until the tax year for which said quinquennial filing is required; provided, that the property remains eligible for the deduction. For the tax years beginning after June 30, 1982, the Mayor shall make applications available to any owner of real property for which the deduction was not obtained for the preceding tax year or 2nd half of the preceding tax year, whichever is applicable.\n\n\"(4A)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, for the tax year beginning July 1, 1992, and ending June 30, 1993, the application required by subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section shall be properly completed and filed by September 15, 1992.\n\n\"(B) An application properly completed and filed by September 15, 1992, shall apply to the tax year beginning July 1, 1992, and ending June 30, 1993, and for succeeding tax years until the tax year for which quinquennial filing of the application is required pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, provided that the property remains eligible for the deduction.\n\n\"(C) If any residential real property owner properly completes and files an application by September 15, 1992, for the deduction provided for under subsection (c)(1) of this section and qualifies for the deduction for the full tax year beginning July 1, 1992, and ending June 30, 1993, or if any residential real property owned by a cooperative housing association for which applications are properly completed and filed by September 15, 1992, for the deduction provided for under subsection (d)(2) of this section qualifies for the deduction for the full tax year beginning July 1, 1992, and ending June 30, 1993, then:\n\n\"(i) The real property shall be classified as Class 1 Property for the full tax year;\n\n\"(ii) No adjustment shall be made to the 1st half tax bill which is due and payable by September 15, 1992; and\n\n\"(iii) The full deduction for the tax year beginning July 1, 1992, and ending June 30, 1993, shall be reflected in the 2nd half tax bill which is due and payable by March 31, 1993.\n\n\"(4B)(A) Effective October 1, 1994, and for each tax year thereafter, any residential real property which is eligible for the homestead deduction shall receive the homestead deduction as of the first full month following the date on which a properly completed application has been filed. The homestead deduction shall be prorated on a monthly basis. The Mayor may prorate the homestead deduction retroactively to the date the property became eligible for the deduction when in his or her judgment good cause exists to do so. The homestead deduction shall be retroactively applied only within the current real property tax year. Real property is eligible for the homestead deduction if it meets the requirements set forth in this section and a properly completed application is filed with the Mayor. The real property shall continue to receive the homestead deduction until the next quinquennial filing, provided the property remains eligible to receive the deduction.\n\n\"(B) Effective October 1, 1994, and for each tax year thereafter, when real property that received the homestead deduction becomes ineligible for the homestead deduction, the owner of the real property shall notify the Mayor (in a manner and at a time as the Mayor may prescribe by regulations) of the real property's ineligibility. The Mayor shall terminate the homestead deduction effective as of the first full month following the date the property became ineligible for the homestead deduction.\n\n\"(5)(A) Effective for the real property tax year that begins on October 1, 1993, any residential real property which is not eligible for the deduction as of October 1, 1993, shall be eligible for the deduction for the second half of the tax year if the property becomes eligible for the deduction by April 1, 1994. To obtain the deduction for the second half of the tax year, an owner of eligible real property shall procure, complete and file an application by March 31, 1994. Applications filed by March 31, 1994, shall be considered for the second half of the tax year that begins on October 1, 1993, and for the succeeding tax years until the tax year for which quinquennial filing of the application is required pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection; provided, that the property remains eligible for the homestead deduction. The Mayor may verify the contents of the applications.\n\n\"(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, effective October 1, 1993, and for each tax year thereafter, the Mayor, upon written request by the owner of eligible real property, may grant a reasonable extension of time, as he or she may prescribe by regulation, for filing the application for the homestead deduction for the second half of the real property tax year, when in the Mayor's judgment good cause exists for the extension. Any written request for an extension of the filing deadline of the application for the homestead deduction for the second half of the real property tax year shall be considered only for the tax year in which it is submitted. If an extension is granted, the property tax liability shall be adjusted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Mayor.\n\n\"(6)(A) Whenever any real property which obtained the deduction provided for in this section for the preceding tax year becomes ineligible for the deduction, the owner of such property shall notify the Mayor (in such manner and at such time as the Mayor shall prescribe) of the termination of eligibility. The Mayor may verify the eligibility of any real property, for which the deduction has been obtained for any tax year, for the deduction for any subsequent tax year.\n\n\"(B)(i) If any owner of real property subject to the provisions of this section who is required to notify the Mayor under this subsection of a termination of eligibility for any tax year fails to notify the Mayor (in such manner and at such time as the Mayor shall prescribe) of such termination, the deduction shall be disallowed for each such tax year and shall be taxed at the appropriate rate of taxation for that class. There shall be added to the tax a penalty of 10% of such tax for each such tax year.\n\n\"(ii) Any owner who negligently fails to notify the Mayor of a termination of eligibility as required under this subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned for not more than 180 days, or both.\n\n\"(iii) Any owner who willfully or knowingly fails to notify the Mayor of a termination of eligibility as required under this subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned for not more than 1 year, or both.\n\n\"(C) The Mayor, pursuant to title 1 of the District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act, approved October 21, 1968 (§ 2-501 et seq.), shall issue rules to implement the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. Such rules shall ensure that the public is educated about the requirement and purposes of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. In promulgating the rules, the Mayor shall direct that all pertinent application and general mailing information clearly and prominently reflect all relevant laws and regulations governing notice to the Mayor of termination of eligibility, including notice of all possible fines and penalties for failure to properly notify the Mayor of eligibility termination. Efforts to educate the public shall be multi-lingual and in alternative formats. The proposed rules shall be submitted to the Council for a 45-day review period, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days of Council recess. If the Council does not approve or disapprove the proposed rules, in whole or in part, by resolution within the 45-day review period, the proposed rules shall be deemed approved.\n\n\"(7) The provisions of this subsection shall apply with respect to tax years beginning after June 30, 1982.\n\n\"(f) In relation to property tax bills required to be paid on September 15, 1977, and on March 31, 1978, by owners of property eligible for the exemption provided in subsection (a) of this section:\n\n\"(1) The Mayor shall indicate on each tax bill, to the extent feasible, the fact and amount of the exemption and shall enclose with such tax bills a notice which includes at least the following information:\n\n\"(A) The amount of the deduction;\n\n\"(B) The name of §§ 47-849 to 47-856 and the date on which it was enacted by the Council of the District of Columbia; and\n\n\"(C) The exact amount by which the deduction has reduced the property owner's tax bill;\n\n\"(2) Any mortgage lender, including but not limited to a savings and loan association, a commercial bank, and a mortgage banker which receives such a property tax bill and pays it on behalf of the owner of the property in question shall forward to said property owner not later than 4 months after the date on which the property tax payment is due:\n\n\"(A) A copy of said property tax bill; and\n\n\"(B) A copy of the notice required by paragraph (1) of this subsection.\n\n\"(g) In relation to property tax bills required to be paid after March 31, 1978, the information specified in subsection (f)(1)(A) and (C) of this section shall be included on the face of each tax bill. Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the duty of the Mayor to include an explanation of the exemption provided in subsection (a) of this section on a notice of assessment, as required by § 47-824(9).\"\n\nD.C.
