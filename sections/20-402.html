        <dl>
            
                <dt>a</dt>
                <dd> A prayer for supervised administration may be made in the petition for probate. The Court shall order supervised administration of a decedent's estate only:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> If the decedent's will directs supervised administration;</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> If the decedent's will directs unsupervised administration, but for good cause shown the Court finds that supervised administration is necessary for the protection of persons interested in the estate; or</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> In other cases where, for good cause shown, the Court finds that supervised administration is necessary under the circumstances which the Court shall specify.</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> In no event shall the appointment of a personal representative be delayed pending the Court's decision pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. Thus, whenever the Court must make a decision under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, the Court shall appoint the personal representative in unsupervised administration; thereafter, an Order for supervised administration shall convert the proceeding to supervised administration.</dd>
