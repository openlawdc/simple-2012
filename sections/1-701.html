                <dd> The Congress finds that the retirement benefits authorized by various acts of Congress for the police officers, fire fighters, teachers, and judges of the District of Columbia have not been financed on an actuarially sound basis. Neither federal payments to the District nor District of Columbia appropriations have taken into account the long-term financial requirements of the District's retirement programs. As a result, the annual budget cost to the District of Columbia for annuities and refunds of deductions is growing at a rapid rate, and, in the case of the retirement program for police officers and fire fighters, is predicted to exceed the cost of salaries for active police officers and fire fighters by the year 2000.</dd>
