1981 Ed., § 40-624.1.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-289, in subsec. (d), par. (9), substituted "Department of Motor Vehicles" for "Department of Public Works"; and rewrote subsec. (e), which had read:

"(e) A fleet owner who participates in the fleet adjudication program shall answer, within 15 days of receipt, the monthly fleet infraction report which sets forth the date and time of the infraction, as well as other information contained in the original notice of infraction. Answers shall be consistent with <a href='./50-2303.05.html'>§ 50-2303.05(a)</a>."

D.C. Law 15-307, in subsec. (a), deleted "engaged in commercial activity" following "motor vehicles" in par. (1), and deleted "engaged in the regular course of business in the District of Columbia" following "motor vehicles" in par. (2); in subsec. (b), substituted "notices of infraction for parking violations and for violations detected by an automated traffic enforcement system," for "notices of infraction"; and rewrote pars. (1) and (3) of subsec. (d) and subsec. (e) which had read:

"(1) Register its fleet engaged in the regular course of business in the District of Columbia with the Department of Motor Vehicles;"

"(3) Satisfy all outstanding parking infractions prior to registration in the program."

"(e) A fleet owner participant in the fleet adjudication program shall answer, within 30 days of receipt, the monthly fleet infraction report, which sets forth the date and time of the infraction and other information contained in the original notice of infraction. Answers shall be consistent with <a href='./50-2303.05.html'>§ 50- 2303.05</a>. The owner's failure to answer within 30 days shall result in the imposition of monetary penalties established by <a href='./50-2301.05.html'>§ 50-2301.05</a>, in addition to the potential civil fine for the infraction. If the owner fails to answer within 60 days, the owner shall be deemed liable for the violations. The Director may suspend program participation for multiple violations of this subsection."

D.C. Law 16-279, in subsec. (e), substituted "<a href='./50-2303.05.html'>§ 50-2303.05</a> and <a href='./50-2209.02.html'>§ 50-2209.02</a>" for "§ 2302.05 and with <a href='./50-2209.02.html'>§ 50-2209.02(b)</a>".

D.C. Law 17-217, in subsec. (b), inserted "or an automated parking enforcement system" following "automated traffic enforcement system".

D.C. Law 18-111 rewrote subsecs. (a), (d), (e), and (f); and, in the section name line and subsec. (b), substituted "reconciliation" for "adjudication". Prior to amendment, subsecs. (a), (d), (e) and (f) read as follows:

"(a) For the purposes of this section, the term:

"(1) 'Fleet' means 5 or more company owned or long-term leased motor vehicles. The term fleet shall not include motor vehicles which are vehicles for hire pursuant to <a href='./47-2829.html'>§ 47-2829</a>.

"(2) 'Motor vehicle fleet owner' means any corporation, firm, agency, association, organization, or other entity holding legal title to 5 or more company owned or leased motor vehicles."

"(d) To participate in the fleet adjudication program, a motor vehicle fleet owner shall:

"(1) Register its fleet with the Department of Motor Vehicles;

"(2) Pay a registration fee to cover the District government's administrative costs for the fleet adjudication program; and

"(3) Satisfy all outstanding parking infractions and all outstanding moving infractions under <a href='./50-2209.02.html'>§ 50-2209.02</a> prior to registration in the program.

"(e) A fleet owner participating in the fleet adjudication program shall answer the monthly fleet infraction report within 30 days of its receipt, which sets forth the date and time of the infraction and other information contained in the original notice of infraction. Answers shall be consistent with <a href='./50-2303.05.html'>§ 50- 2303.05</a> and <a href='./50-2209.02.html'>§ 50-2209.02</a>, whichever is applicable. The Director may suspend program participation for more than one violation of this subsection.

"(f) The fleet owner shall be primarily liable for the civil penalties imposed pursuant to this section."

D.C. Law 19-171 made a technical amendment to D.C. Law 18-111 to insert an enacting clause for § 6003(f) that resulted in the addition of subsec. (e-1) and revival of subsec. (f) as it existed prior to D.C. Law 18-111.
