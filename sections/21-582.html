Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-283 rewrote subsec. (a); and in subsec. (b), deleted "alleged mentally ill" from the first sentence. Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) had read as follows:

"(a) A petition, application, or certificate authorized under section 21-521 and subsection (a) of section 21-541 may not be considered if made by a physician or qualified psychologist who is related by blood or marriage to the alleged mentally ill person, or who is financially interested in the hospital in which the alleged mentally ill person is to be detained, or, except in the case of physicians or qualified psychologists employed by the United States or the District of Columbia, who are professionally or officially connected with the hospital."

D.C. Law 17-231, in subsec. (a)(1), substituted "blood, marriage, or domestic partnership" for "blood or marriage".

"(a) A petition, application, or certificate authorized under section 21-521, section 21-541(a), section 21-545.01, or section 21-548 may not be considered if made by a psychiatrist, physician, or qualified psychologist who:

"(1) Is related by blood or marriage to the person about whom the petition, application, or certificate is made;

"(2) Is financially interested in the hospital in which the person is to be detained; or

"(3) Except in the case of psychiatrists, physicians, or qualified psychologists employed by the United States or the District of Columbia, are professionally or officially connected with the hospital.".

; and in subsec. (b), in the first sentence, deleted "alleged mentally ill".
