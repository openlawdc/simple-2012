If the court orders the subpoena to be issued the costs incurred by the process and the fees of the witness so subpoenaed shall be paid in the same manner in which similar costs and fees are paid in case of a witness subpoenaed in behalf of the prosecuting authority.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., ยง 23-106.\n\n1973 Ed., ยง 23-106.\n\nDC CODE ยง 23-106\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(July 29, 1970, 84 Stat. 607, Pub.
