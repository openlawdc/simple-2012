Section 2 of D.C. Laws 13-087 added the School Proximity Traffic Calming Temporary Act of 1999 to provide:

"a) The Mayor is authorized to install traffic control devices, as deemed necessary, after completing an investigation of school zones.

"(b) The Mayor shall, when conducting an investigation, consider the number of persons who have been hit by a vehicle, bicycle, or motorcycle in a school zone, the likelihood of these accidents occurring in the future and the volume of traffic.

"(c) The District of Columbia Public Schools and the Metropolitan Police Department shall submit monthly statistical reports to the Mayor which shall include:

"(1) The number of persons who were hit by a vehicle, bicycle or motorcycle in and around school zones; and

"(2) The type of injuries suffered.

"(d) The information in subsection (c) of this section shall be made available, within 15 days from the date of request from the Mayor.

"(e) School zones shall have a speed limit posted at 15 miles per hour and signs erected warning of the existence of children. For those school zones that have a traffic control device, signs shall be erected warning of the existence of these devices.

"(f) At least one crossing guard shall be placed at elementary schools. Crossing guards shall be placed at middle or junior high schools, and high schools where deemed necessary by the Metropolitan Police Department.

"(g) Traffic control devices, when constructed and posted pursuant to this section, shall not be deemed obstructions of the road or street. No action shall be brought on behalf of any party against the District for damages caused by a speed control device.

"(h) The Mayor shall submit a report to the Council which shall include the findings of the investigation and the type of traffic control devices that should be installed at all school zones within 60 days from the effective date of this act.

"(i) For purposes of this act, "traffic control devices" includes traffic signals, flashing red and yellow signals, stop signs, signs that warn of the existence of children, markers, speed humps or bumps, rumble strips, or signs that reduce the speed limit."
