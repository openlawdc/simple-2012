1981 Ed., § 47-872.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-305, in subsec. (d), substituted "percentage increase in the local Consumer Price Index for all items" for "percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') for all items, in the Washington, D.C. Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area,".

D.C. Law 14-307 rewrote subsec. (a); and in subsec. (b), deleted "or a single dwelling unit that is owned by a member of a homeowners association if the condominium or" following "condominium". Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) had read as follows:

"(a) For the purpose of computing taxes on real property in the District of Columbia for the tax year beginning July 1, 1991, and ending June 30, 1992, and for each subsequent tax year, a real property owner shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by <a href='./47-811.html'>§ 47-811</a>, if the improved residential real property:

"(1) Is occupied by the owner of the improved residential real property;

"(2) Is a single dwelling unit owned as a condominium or is a single dwelling unit that is owned by a member of a homeowners association; and

"(3) Is used exclusively for nontransient residential dwelling purposes."

D.C. Law 15-354, in subsec. (b), validated a previously made technical correction.
