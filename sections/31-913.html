Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-214 rewrote the section which had read:

"All the costs and expenses connected with a plan of conversion shall be paid for or reimbursed by the mutual company or the converted stock company except where the plan provides either for a holding company to acquire the stock of the converted stock company or for the merger of the mutual company into a stock insurance company as provided in <a href='./31-906.html'>§ 31-906(e)</a>. In those cases, the acquiring holding company or the stock insurance company shall pay for or reimburse all the costs and expenses connected with the plan."
