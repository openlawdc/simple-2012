D.C. Law 14-282 rewrote subsec. (b) and (d); and added subsec. (h). Prior to amendment, subsecs. (b) and (d) had read as follows:

"(b) If real property (or a portion thereof), which is exempt or immune from real property taxation under <a href='./47-1002.html'>§ 47-1002(1)</a> through (3) or the law of the United States, is leased, loaned, or otherwise made available to any person in connection with a business or as a residence, or both, and the use is not for an exempt purpose and the person is not exempt or immune from income taxation under the laws of the United States or District of Columbia, the leasehold interest, possessory interest, beneficial interest, or beneficial use of the lessee or user of the real property shall be assessed and taxed:

"(1) On the portion of the real property leased, used, or made available for the nonexempt purpose; and

"(2) For the percentage of time during the real property tax year that the lease, use, or availability for the nonexempt purpose can be segregated and identified."

"(d) The taxable value of a leasehold interest, possessory interest, beneficial interest, or beneficial use for the purpose of this section shall be determined in the same manner as the taxable value of the real property would otherwise be determined if the lessee or user of the real property were the owner of the real property and the real property were not exempt from taxation; provided, that the taxable value determined shall be reduced by a percentage of the taxable value that is equal to the:

"(1) Percentage of the real property that is not actually leased or used by, or made available to, the lessee or user during the real property tax year; and

"(2) Percentage of time that the real property is not actually leased or used by, or made available to, the lessee or user during the real property tax year."
