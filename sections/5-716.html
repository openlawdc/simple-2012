Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-172 added subsec. (a-1), relating to additional annuities for certain individuals, and added par. (e)(5), relating to annuity payments to children with a surviving parent.

D.C. Law 14-28 rewrote subsec. (c)(1)(B) and (1)(C), rewrote the second sentence of subsec. (d) which had read: "Each child who, on said effective date, was receiving relief or annuity computed in accordance with the provisions of this section, shall be entitled to benefits computed in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.", and rewrote subsec. (e)(5). Prior to amendment, subsecs. (c)(1)(B), (1)(C), and (e)(5) read as follows:

"(c) Each surviving child or student child of any member who dies before retirement, of any former member who dies after retirement, or of any member entitled to receive an annuity under <a href='./5-717.html'>§ 5-717</a> (regardless of whether such member is receiving such annuity at the time of death), shall be entitled to receive an annuity equal to the smallest of:

"(1) In the case of a member or former member who is survived by a wife or husband:

"(B) $2,918.00, to be increased on an annual basis by the cost of living adjustment determined pursuant to <a href='./5-718.html'>§ 5-718</a>; or

"(C) $8,754.00, divided by the number of eligible children, to be increased on an annual basis by the cost of living adjustment determined pursuant to <a href='./5-718.html'>§ 5- 718</a>, divided by the number of eligible children; and".

"(e)(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, no annuity of a child or student of a widow or widower under subsection (a-1) of this section shall be paid while an annuity benefit to a widow or widower under subsection (a-1) of this section is being paid."

D.C. Law 15-354 added subsec. (a-2).

D.C. Law 17-321, in subsecs. (e)(1) and (2), substituted "the day after the date on which the member or former member dies" for "1st day of the month in which the member or former member dies".

<a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%20111-282'>Pub. L. 111-282</a>, in subsec. (b)(2), inserted ", or, for a member who was an officer or member of the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division, or the United States Secret Service Division, 40 percent of the corresponding salary for step 5 of the Officer rank in section 10203 of title 5, United States Code".

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, § 711 (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.11.html'>§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.14.html'>§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.
