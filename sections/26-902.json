Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act. 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1- 207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nTransfer of Functions\n\nAll functions of the Superintendent of Licenses were transferred to the Director of the Department of Economic Development by Commissioner's Order No. 69-96, dated March 7, 1969. The Department of Economic Development was replaced by the Department of Licenses, Investigation and Inspection by Mayor's Order No. 78-42, dated February 17, 1978.\n\nDC CODE § 26-902\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Feb. 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 657, ch. 26, § 2; Mar. 3, 1917, 39 Stat. 1006, ch. 160.)","sections":[],"division":{"identifier":"V","text":"Local Business Affairs"},"title":{"identifier":"26","text":"Banks and Other Financial Institutions.
