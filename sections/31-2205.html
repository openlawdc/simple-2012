                <dt>iii</dt>
                <dd> Reinsurance recoverable on paid losses from unauthorized insurers that are included as an asset in the annual statement, but only to the extent a liability for such unauthorized recoverables is included in the liabilities report in the trusteed surplus statement;</dd>
            
                <dt>iv</dt>
                <dd> Special state deposits held for the exclusive benefit of policyholders, or policyholders and creditors, of any particular state not exceeding net liabilities reports for that state;</dd>
            
                <dt>v</dt>
                <dd> Secured accrued retrospective premiums;</dd>
            
                <dt>vi</dt>
                <dd> If a life insurer, the amount of its policy loans to policyholders within the United States, not exceeding the amount of legal reserve required on each such policy, and the net amount of uncollected and deferred premiums; and</dd>
            
                <dt>vii</dt>
                <dd> Any other nontrusteed asset which the Commissioner determines secures liabilities in a substantially similar manner; and</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> Any additional information that the Commissioner may require relating to the total business or assets, or any portion thereof, of the non-U.S. insurer.</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> The annual statement and trusteed surplus statement shall be signed and verified by the United States manager, attorney-in-fact, or a duly empowered assistant United States manager of the U.S. Branch. The items of securities and other property held under trust deeds shall be certified in the trusteed surplus statement by the United States trustee or trustees.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> Every report on examination of a U.S. Branch shall include a trusteed surplus statement as of the date of examination in addition to the general statement of the financial condition of the U.S. Branch.</dd>
