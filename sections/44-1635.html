                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> The institution shall notify the Attorney General for the District of Columbia of the application, and the Attorney General for the District of Columbia shall be given an opportunity to be heard.</dd>

                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> The institutional fund subject to the restriction has a total value of less than $50,000, subject to adjustment pursuant to subsection (e) of this section;</dd>
