Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-20 designated the existing text as subsec. (a); and added subsecs. (b and (c).

Emergency Act Amendments

For temporary (90 day) amendment of section, see § 3002 of Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Support Emergency Act of 2007 (D.C. Act 17-74, July 25, 2007, 54 DCR 7549).

Legislative History of Laws

Law 17-20, the "Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Support Act of 2007", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 17-148 which was referred to the Committee of the Whole. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on May 15, 2007, and June 5, 2007, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on June 28, 2007, it was assigned Act No. 17-63 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 17-20 became effective on September 18, 2007.

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, § 711 (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.11.html'>§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.14.html'>§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.

Miscellaneous Notes

Short title: Section 3001 of D.C. Law 17-20 provided that subtitle A of title III of the act may be cited as the "Metropolitan Police Department Grant-Making Authority Clarification Amendment Act of 2007".
