{"text":"As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., § 35-1802.\n\n1973 Ed., § 35-1702.\n\nEffect of Amendments\n\nD.C. Law 14-251 rewrote par. (2); added par. (3A); and substituted \"basic property insurance or homeowner's insurance\" for \"basic property insurance\" in pars. (4) and (5). Prior to amendment, par. (2) had read as follows:\n\n\"(2) The term 'basic property insurance' means:\n\n\"(A) Insurance against direct loss to property caused by perils as defined and limited in the standard fire policy and extended coverage endorsement thereon, as approved by the Mayor; and\n\n\"(B) Such other insurance (including insurance against the perils of vandalism, malicious mischief, burglary, theft, and robbery) as the Mayor may designate (under regulations adopted or made under § 31-5004) from those lines of property insurance for which reinsurance is available for losses from riots or civil disorders under part B of title XII of the National Housing Act.\"\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nFor Law 14-251, see notes following § 31-5001.\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nDelegation of functions: Reorganization Order No. 43, as amended August 12, 1968, delegated to the Superintendent of Insurance the functions vested in the Mayor by this chapter.\n\nDepartment of Insurance abolished: The Department of Insurance, including the Superintendent, was abolished and the functions thereof transferred to the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia by Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. Reorganization Order No. 43, dated June 23, 1953, as amended, established, under the direction and control of a Commissioner, a Department of Insurance headed by a Superintendent. The Order provided for the organization of the Department, abolished the previously existing Department of Insurance, and provided that all functions and positions of the previous Department would be transferred to the new Department of Insurance, including the duties, powers, and authorities of all officers and employees; and that all personnel, property, records and unexpended balances relating to the functions and positions transferred would also be transferred to the new Department. The executive functions of the Board of Commissioners were transferred to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia by § 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967. The functions of the Superintendent of Insurance were transferred to the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1983, effective March 31, 1983. Pursuant to the provisions of D.C. Law 11- 268, the Department of Insurance and Securities Regulation was established and the duties of the Superintendent of Insurance and the Insurance Administration were assumed by the Commissioner of Insurance and Securities and the Insurance Administration in the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs was abolished.\n\nDC CODE § 31-5002\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Aug. 1, 1968, 82 Stat. 568, Pub.
