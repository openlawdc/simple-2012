        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-293 rewrote the section, which formerly read:

''(1) Make or authorize an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation or fund;

"(2) Involve the District in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made unless authorized by law;

"(3) Approve a disbursement without appropriate authorization; or

"(4) Defer recording a transaction incurred in the current fiscal year to a future fiscal year."

D.C. Law 19-168, in par. (1), substituted "agency, fund, or capital project" for "agency or fund"; in par. (2), substituted "unless authorized by law; provided, that this paragraph shall not prohibit the acceptance of voluntary services or employment of personal services exceeding that authorized by law during emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property" for "unless authorized by law" ;   in par. (7), deleted "or" from the end;  in par. (8), substituted ";  or" for a period at the end;   and added par. (9).
