Effect of Amendments

"(a) Transportation for students with disabilities, tuition payments for private placements for students with disabilities, and state education agency functions of the DCPS system are not covered by the Formula and shall be appropriated by the Mayor and Council in addition to the amount generated by the Formula.

"(b) DCPS in its function as the state education agency for the District of Columbia shall perform all state education agency functions for Public Charter Schools that it performs for private schools and for DCPS in its function as a local education agency."
