        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-360, in subsec. (a), substituted "5.7% of general sales tax revenue (net dedicated taxes)" for "0.5% of sales tax revenue".

D.C. Law 18-111 rewrote subsec. (a); and added subsec. (a-1) and (a-2). Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) read as follows:

"(a) There is hereby established a fund designated as the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Fund, which shall be separate from the General Fund of the District of Columbia. An amount equal to 5.7% of general sales tax revenue (net dedicated taxes) collected annually under Chapter 20 of Title 47, apportioned from the proceeds of such annual sales tax revenues other than dedicated taxes as defined under <a href='./1-204.90.html'>§ 1-204.90(n)(5)</a>), shall be deposited into the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Fund without regard to fiscal year limitation pursuant to an act of Congress and shall not revert to the General Fund of the District of Columbia at the end of any fiscal year or at any other time, but shall be continually available as a dedicated funding source for the uses and purposes set forth in subsection (b) of this section, subject to authorization by Congress in an appropriations act."

Signed by the Mayor on April 21, 2006, it was assigned Act No. 16-350 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 16-132 became effective on June 16, 2006.

Miscellaneous Notes

Section 3(3) of Law 16-132 required that the fiscal effect of Law 16-132 be included in an approved budget and financial plan in order for Law 16-132 to apply as law. The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of November 2, 2007, that the fiscal effect of Law 16-132 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 16-98, are not in effect.

Section 3(b) of D.C. Law 17-360 repealed section 3(3) of D.C. Law 16-132 and restored this section.

Short title: Section 6070 of D.C. Law 18-111 provided that subtitle H of title VI of the act may be cited as the "Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Fund Amendment Act of 2009".
