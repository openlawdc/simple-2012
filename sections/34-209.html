        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-227 rewrote the section which had read:

"The term 'gas corporation' when used in this subtitle includes every corporation, company, association, joint-stock company or association, partnership, or person manufacturing, making, distributing, or selling gas for light, heat, or power, or for any public use whatsoever in the District of Columbia, their lessees, trustees, or receivers, appointed by any court whatsoever, and in said district owning, operating, controlling, or managing any gas plant, except where the gas is made or produced and distributed by the maker on or through private property solely for its own use or the use of its tenants and not for sale to or for the use of others."

D.C. Law 16-191 made a change in the directory language of D.C. Law 15-227 which resulted in no change in text.
