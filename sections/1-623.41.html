"On or after April 1, 1990, increases in compensation payable due to disability or death shall be in the same percentage amount and shall have the same effective date as any base salary increase granted, pursuant to §<a href='./1-611.05.html'>§ 1-611.05</a> and 1-611.06, to employees in the Career and Excepted Services not covered by collective bargaining. To be eligible for the increase, the disability or death of the employee must have occurred at least 1 year prior to the effective date of the increase."
