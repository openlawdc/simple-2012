The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia.

Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made, in brackets, in this section.\n\nTransfer of Functions\n\nFunctions vested in the Department of Public Health were transferred to the Department of Human Resources by Commissioner's Order No. 70-83, dated March 6, 1970. The Department of Human Resources was replaced by the Department of Human Services by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1979, dated February 21, 1980.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nEstablishment of Commission on Medical Examiner's Office: See Mayor's Order 89-62, March 28, 1989.\n\nDC CODE § 11-2301\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(July 29, 1970, 84 Stat. 518, Pub.
