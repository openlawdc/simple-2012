Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-84 added subsec. (c).

D.C. Law 14-185, in the section heading, substituted "District of Columbia domicile" for "District residency"; and rewrote subsec. (a) which had read as follows:

"(a) Any person who accepts appointment or is hired to fill a position in the Executive Service shall become a bona fide resident of the District within 180 days of the effective date of appointment and shall maintain District residency for the duration of the appointment. Failure to become a District resident or to maintain District residency shall result in forfeiture of the position to which the person has been appointed."

D.C. Law 14-213 repealed subsec. (c) which had read as follows:

"(c) The provisions of subsection (a) of this section may be waived for Elliott B. Branch, confirmed as Chief Procurement Officer for a 5-year term beginning November 2, 1999."

D.C. Law 15-105 validated a previously made technical correction.

D.C. Law 17-108 repealed subsec. (b), which had read as follows:

"(b) The provisions of subsection (a) of this section may be waived for an individual appointed as Chief Technology Officer."
