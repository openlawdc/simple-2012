        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 19-37 rewrote subsecs. (a) and (c); in the lead-in language of subsec. (b), substituted "Public schools, public charter schools, and participating private schools" for "Public schools and public charter schools"; in subsec. (b)(5), inserted "and sufficient time during the lunch period for every student to pass through the food service line,". Prior to amendment, subsecs. (a) and (c) read as follows:

"(a)(1) Public schools and public charter schools shall offer free breakfast to all students.

"(2) If more than 40% of the students at a school qualify for free or reduced-price meals:

"(A) A public elementary school and a public charter elementary school shall offer breakfast in the classroom each day; and

"(B) A public middle and high school and a public charter middle and high school shall offer alternative serving models, such as breakfast in the classroom or grab-and-go carts, each day to increase breakfast participation."

"(c) Public schools and public charter schools are encouraged to make cold, filtered water available free to students, through water fountains or other means, when meals are served to students in public schools and public charter schools."

D.C. Law 19-168, in subsec. (c), substituted "shall" for "are encouraged to".
