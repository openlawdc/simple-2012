Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-9 substituted "Chancellor" for "District of Columbia Board of Education" and "Board of Education".

D.C. Law 17-325 rewrote pars. (1) and (2) which had read as follows:

"(1) Within a period of not more that 90 or less than 45 days prior to the annual submission by the Chancellor of a proposed budget to the Mayor of the District of Columbia, and upon 15 days public notice, the Chancellor shall conduct a public hearing for the purpose of soliciting the views of the public on programs and levels of public funding to be sought for the public schools. The budget proposed by the Chancellor shall, consistent with the public policy declared in this measure, give due consideration to the record established by the testimony and exhibits on the subjects listed in paragraph (4) of this section. The Chancellor shall transmit the record of this hearing to the Mayor of the District of Columbia and to the Council of the District of Columbia at or before the hearings held by them pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of this section.

"(2) Within a period of not more than 60 days or less than 30 days prior to the Mayor's annual submission of a budget recommendation with respect to the public schools to the Council of the District of Columbia, and upon 15 days public notice, the Mayor of the District of Columbia shall conduct a public hearing for the purpose of soliciting the views of the public on levels of public funding to be sought for the public schools. In no event shall this hearing be prior to the annual submission by the Chancellor of its proposed budget to the Mayor. The public schools budget recommendation submitted by the Mayor to the Council of the District of Columbia shall, consistent with the public policy declared in this measure, give due consideration to the record established by the testimony and exhibits on the subjects listed in paragraph (4) of this section. The Mayor shall transmit the record of this hearing to the Council of the District of Columbia at or before the hearing held pursuant to paragraph (3) of this section."

D.C. Law 17-353, in par. (2), validated a previously made technical correction.
