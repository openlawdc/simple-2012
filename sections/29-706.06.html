                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> The act would have bound the limited partnership under § 29-704.02 before the dissociation; and</dd>

                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> If a general partner or another person dissociated as a general partner is liable for the obligation, to the general partner or other person for any damage caused to the general partner or other person arising from the liability.</dd>
