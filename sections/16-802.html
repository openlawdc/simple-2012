                <dd> A person arrested for or charged with the commission of a criminal offense pursuant to the District of Columbia Official Code or the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations whose prosecution has been terminated without conviction may file a motion with the Clerk at any time to seal all of the records of the arrest and related court proceedings on grounds of actual innocence.</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> The burden is on the movant to establish that:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>

                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> The movant did not commit the offense.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> If the motion is filed within 4 years after the prosecution has been terminated, the movant must satisfy the burden described in subsection (b) of this section by a preponderance of the evidence.</dd>

                <dd> In determining such motions, the court may, but is not required to, employ a rebuttable presumption that the movant is not entitled to relief if the court finds that the government has been substantially prejudiced in its ability to respond to the motion by the delay in its filing, unless the movant shows that the motion is based on grounds which the person could not have raised by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the circumstances prejudicial to the government occurred.</dd>
            
                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd> An acquittal does not establish a presumption that the movant is innocent or entitled to relief pursuant to this section.</dd>

                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> The Court shall order that the movant's name be redacted to the extent practicable from records that are not sealed. The Court may make an in camera inspection of these records in order to make this determination.</dd>

                <dt>D</dt>

                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> Order the prosecutor to arrange for any computerized record of the movant's arrest, prosecution, or conviction to be eliminated except for a restricted-access file that would permit the prosecutor and law enforcement agencies to retrieve sealed records if ordered to do so by the Court; and</dd>
            
                <dt>C</dt>
                <dd> Expressly allow the prosecutor and law enforcement agencies to maintain a publicly available record so long as it is not retrievable by the identification of the movant.</dd>
