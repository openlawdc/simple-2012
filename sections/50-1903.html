                <p>Only a physician or registered nurse acting at the request of a police officer may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content or the drug content thereof. This limitation shall not apply to the taking of a breath or urine specimen. The person tested may, in addition to submitting to the 2 tests administered at the direction of a police officer, also submit to a chemical test or tests administered to him by a physician, registered nurse, or other person of his own choosing who is qualified to administer such test or tests. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of the tests taken at the direction of a police officer.</p>
