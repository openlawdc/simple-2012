"(b) A claim for legal or other services furnished on behalf of a claimant in respect to a case, claim, or award for compensation under this subchapter is valid only if approved by the Mayor."

D.C. Law 18-223 rewrote subsecs. (a) and (b); and repealed subsec. (d). Prior to repeal or amendment, subsecs. (a), (b), and (d) read as follows:

"(a) A claimant may authorize an individual to represent him or her in a request for reconsideration of a decision under <a href='./1-623.24.html'>§ 1-623.24(a-4)</a> or in a proceeding before an administrative law judge under <a href='./1-623.24.html'>§ 1-623.24(b)</a>.

"(b)(1) For the purposes of this subsection, the term 'successful prosecution' means obtaining an award of compensation that exceeds the amount that was previously awarded, offered, or determined.   The term 'successful prosecution' includes a reinstatement or partial reinstatement of benefits which are reduced or terminated.

"(2) If a person utilizes the services of an attorney-at-law in the successful prosecution of his or her claim under <a href='./1-623.24.html'>§ 1-623.24(b)</a> or before any court for review of any actions, award, order, or decisions, there shall be awarded, in addition to the award of compensation, in a compensation order, a reasonable attorney's fee, not to exceed 20% of the actual benefit secured, which fee award shall be paid directly by the Mayor or his or her designee to the attorney for the claimant in a lump sum within 30 days after the date of the compensation order."

"(d)(1) In all cases, fees for attorneys representing the claimant shall be approved in the manner herein provided. If any proceedings are had before the administrative law judge or any court for review of any actions, award, order, or decision, the administrative law judge or court shall approve an attorney's fee for the work done before him or it, as the case may be, by the attorney for the claimant.

"(2) An approved attorney's fee, in cases in which the obligation to pay the fee is upon the claimant, may be made a lien upon the compensation order due under an award, and the administrative law judge or court shall fix in the award approving the fee such lien and manner of payment."

D.C. Law 19-21 rewrote subsec. (b); and added subsec. (e). Prior to amendment, subsec. (b) read as follows:

"(b) In all cases, a claim for legal or other services furnished on behalf of a claimant in respect to a case, claim, or award for compensation under this title shall be valid only if approved by the administrative law judge."
