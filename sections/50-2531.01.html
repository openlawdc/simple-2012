        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 19-168 rewrote subsec. (a); and, in subsec. (b), substituted "continually available for projects within the zone from which revenues were raised for" for "continually available for". Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) read as follows:

"(a) There is established as a nonlapsing fund the Performance Parking Program Fund ('Fund'). All parking-meter revenue collected within the Performance Parking Pilot Zones shall be deposited in the Fund. The Fund shall be used solely for the purposes set forth in § 50-2534 and shall be administered by the Director of the District Department of Transportation."
