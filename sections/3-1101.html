Editor's Notes

The reference in paragraph (2) to "<a href='./3-1107.html'>§ 3-1107</a>" appeared in D.C. Law 5-183 as "<a href='./2-3106.html'>§ 2-3106</a> [1981 Ed.]." The reference should have been to 2-3107 [1981 Ed.], given the sense of the text. <a href='./2-3107.html'>Section 2-3107</a> was recodified as <a href='./3-1107.html'>§ 3-1107</a> in the 2001 Edition.
