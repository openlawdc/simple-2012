Section 8 of the Act of June 16, 1936 (49 Stat. 1521), and § 1(b) of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1938, both referred to in the first sentence of this section, were repealed by § 2(19) and (21) of the Act of August 27, 1958, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=72&page=919'>72 Stat. 919</a>, <a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%2085-767'>Pub.

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, § 711 (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.11.html'>§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.14.html'>§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.
