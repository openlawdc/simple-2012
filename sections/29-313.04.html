                <dd> If a corporation does not within a reasonable time allow a shareholder to inspect and copy any other record, the shareholder that complies with § 29- 313.02(b) and (c) may apply to the Superior Court for an order to permit inspection and copying of the records demanded. The court shall dispose of an application under this subsection on an expedited basis.</dd>
