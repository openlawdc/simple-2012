Legislative History of Laws

Law 6-73, "Mandatory Use of Seat Belts Act of 1985," was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 6-16, which was referred to the Committee on Public Works. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on September 24, 1985, and October 8, 1985, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on October 18, 1985, it was assigned Act No. 6-97 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review.

Miscellaneous Notes

Expiration of Law 6-73: Section 9(b) of D.C. Law 6-73 provided that the act shall expire immediately upon the date that the Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation, or his or her designee, determines to rescind the portion of standard 208 of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety, promulgated December 25, 1968 (33 Fed. R. 19703; 49 CFR part 571.208), which requires the installation of automatic restraints in new private passenger motor vehicles, unless the secretary's decision to rescind standard 208 is not based on the enactment or the continued operation of the act.
