{"text":"","historical":"Effect of Amendments\n\nD.C. Law 17-231, in subsec. (d), substituted \"marital or domestic partnership\" for \"marital\".\n\nD.C. Law 18-197 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:\n\n\"(a) For the purposes of this section, the term 'payment' means a payment that a trustee may receive over a fixed number of years or during the life of one or more individuals because of services rendered or property transferred to the payer in exchange for future payments. The term \"payment\" includes a payment made in money or property from the payor's general assets or from a separate fund created by the payer, including a private or commercial annuity, an individual retirement account, and a pension, profit-sharing, stock-bonus, or stock-ownership plan.\n\n\"(b) To the extent that a payment is characterized as interest or a dividend or a payment made in lieu of interest or a dividend, a trustee shall allocate it to income. The trustee shall allocate to principal the balance of the payment and any other payment received in the same accounting period that is not characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment.\n\n\"(c) If no part of a payment is characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment, and all or part of the payment is required to be made, a trustee shall allocate to income 10 percent of the part that is required to be made during the accounting period and the balance to principal. If no part of a payment is required to be made or the payment received is the entire amount to which the trustee is entitled, the trustee shall allocate the entire payment to principal. For purposes of this subsection, a payment is not \"required to be made\" to the extent that it is made because the trustee exercises a right of withdrawal.\n\n\"(d) If, to obtain an estate tax marital or domestic partnership deduction for a trust, a trustee must allocate more of a payment to income than provided for by this section, the trustee shall allocate to income the additional amount necessary to obtain the marital or domestic partnership deduction.\n\n\"(e) This section does not apply to payments to which § 28-4804.10 applies.\"\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nFor Law 13-292, see notes following § 28-4801.01.\n\nFor Law 17-231, see notes following § 28-4801.04.\n\nLaw 18-197, the \"Uniform Principal and Income Technical Amendments Act of 2010\", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 18-563, which was referred to the Committee on Public Safety and the Judiciary.
