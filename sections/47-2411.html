No such refund or allowance shall be made unless the owner of such stamps shall file a written claim therefor with the Mayor of the District of Columbia or his designated agent within the time prescribed in this section and unless the Mayor or his designated agent upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of the facts, and subject to regulations prescribed by the Council of the District of Columbia, certifies that such refund or allowance is just and equitable.</dd>
