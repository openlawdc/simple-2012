References in Text

The references to §§ 36-501 and 36-502, at the end of subsection (c) of this section, are references to those sections as they appeared in the 1973 Edition of the D.C. Code. Chapter 5 of Title 36 [1973 Ed.] was revised by the Act of July 1, 1980, D.C. Law 3-77. D.C. Law 3-77 repealed §§ 36-501 and 36-502 as they appeared in the 1973 Edition of the D.C. Code.   Therefore the reference to these sections is no longer relevant.
