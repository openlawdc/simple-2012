{"text":"If the defendant in an action pursuant to this chapter, asserts a set-off or counterclaim, the judge may require a formal plea of set-off to be filed, or may waive the requirement. If the plaintiff requires time to prepare his defense against the counterclaim or set-off, the judge may continue the case for that purpose. When the set-off or counterclaim is for more than the jurisdictional limit of the Small Claims and Conciliation Branch, as provided by section 11-1321, but within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, the action shall nevertheless remain in the Branch and be tried therein in its entirety.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., § 16-3904.\n\n1973 Ed., § 16-3904.\n\nDC CODE § 16-3904\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Dec. 23, 1963, 77 Stat. 610, Pub.
