Transfer of customer from one facility to another.\n\n\"(a) The Department of Human Services may recommend to the Court that a customer committed to the facility be transferred to another facility if the Department of Human Services determines that it would be beneficial and consistent with the habilitation needs of the customer to do so. Notice of the recommendation shall be served on the customer, the customer's counsel, the customer's parent or guardian who petitioned for the commitment and the customer's mental retardation advocate, if one has been appointed. If the proposed transfer is determined by the Court to be a transfer to a more restrictive facility, a mandatory hearing shall be conducted promptly in accordance with the procedures established in subchapter IV of this chapter. If the Court determines that the proposed transfer would be to a less restrictive facility, a Court hearing shall be held only if the customer or his or her parent or guardian requests a hearing by petitioning the Court in writing within 10 days of being notified by the Court of its determination. The hearing shall be held promptly following the request for the hearing. In deciding whether to authorize the transfer, the Court shall consider whether the proposed facility can provide the necessary habilitation and whether it would be the least restrictive means of providing such habilitation. Due consideration shall be given to the relationship of the customer to his or her family, guardian or friends so as to maintain relationships and encourage visits beneficial to the relationship.\n\n\"(b) A customer admitted to a facility can be transferred to another facility if the customer consents to the transfer.\n\n\"(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit transfer of a customer to a health care facility without prior Court approval in an emergency situation when the life of the customer is in danger. In such circumstances, consent of the customer, or parent or guardian who sought the commitment shall be obtained prior to the transfer. In the event the customer cannot consent and there is no person who can be reasonably contacted, such transfer may be made upon the authorization of the Department of Human Services, with notice promptly given to the parent or guardian.\"\n\nD.C. Law 16-264, in subsecs. (a) and (c), substituted \"Department on Disability Services\" for \"Department of Human Services\".\n\nD.C. Law 19-169 substituted \"advocate for a person with an intellectual disability\" for \"mental retardation advocate\"; and substituted \"result of the individual's intellectual disability\" for \"result of the individual's mental retardation\".\n\nTemporary Amendments of Section\n\nFor temporary (225 day) amendment of section, see § 505(h), (i)) of Multiyear Budget Spending Reduction and Support Temporary Act of 1995 (D.C.
