                <dd> If an overpayment exists, the Mayor and the Council shall include within the ensuing budget cycle a line item that requests a reduction in the amount appropriated as the District of Columbia payment to the Funds equal to the full amount of the overpayment.</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> Overpayments or shortfall reductions shall be made in addition to, and notwithstanding, any other payment required herein.</dd>
            
                <dt>d</dt>
                <dd> If at any time the balance of any separate fund comprising the Funds is not sufficient to meet all obligations against the Funds, the Funds shall have claims on the revenues of the District of Columbia to the extent necessary to meet the obligation.</dd>
