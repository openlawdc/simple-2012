                <dd> In each case where the insurer fails to substantially comply with the medical loss ratio requirements set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the insurer shall issue a rebate for all policyholders in an amount determined in accordance with section 2718(b)(1)(B) of the Public Health Service Act, approved March 23, 2010 (124 Stat. 136; 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-18(b)(1)(B). The annual report required by this section shall include the insurer's calculation of the rebates and an explanation of the insurer's plan to issue rebates.

                <dt>e</dt>
                <dd> An insurer's failure to comply with the rebate requirements in subsection (c) of this section or rating band requirements set forth in subsection (d) of this section shall constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice and shall be subject to the penalties in Chapter 22A of this title.</dd>
