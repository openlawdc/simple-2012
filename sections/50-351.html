Legislative History of Laws

Law 3-117 was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 3-346, which was referred to the Committee on Public Services and Consumer Affairs. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on November 12, 1980 and December 9, 1980, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on December 18, 1980, it was assigned Act No. 3-311 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review.

Miscellaneous Notes

Law 19-184 amended this section only "upon the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan, as certified by the Chief Financial Officer to the Budget Director of the Council in a certification published by the Council in the District of Columbia Register." As of the most recent updated publication of this section, the certification required for Law 19-184 has not been made. Therefore this section has not been repealed.
