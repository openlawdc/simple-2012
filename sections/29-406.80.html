                <dd> The taking advantage, directly or indirectly, by a director of a business opportunity shall not be the subject of equitable relief, or give rise to an award of damages or other sanctions against the director, in a proceeding by or in the right of the nonprofit corporation on the ground that the opportunity should have first been offered to the corporation, if before becoming legally obligated or entitled respecting the opportunity the director brings it to the attention of the corporation and action by the members or the directors disclaiming the corporation's interest in the opportunity is taken in compliance with the procedures set forth in § 29-406. 70, as if the decision being made concerned a conflicting interest transaction.</dd>
