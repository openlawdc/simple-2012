                <dd> The court shall exercise the authority conferred in this subchapter so as to encourage the development of maximum self-reliance and independence of the incapacitated individual. The court, on appropriate findings, may appoint a limited guardian, a temporary guardian, or a general guardian. When the court appoints a guardian, it shall appoint the type of guardianship that is least restrictive to the incapacitated individual in duration and scope, taking into account the incapacitated individual's current mental and adaptive limitations or other conditions warranting the appointment.</dd>

                <dd> The court may appoint a guardian as requested if it is satisfied that the individual for whom a guardian is sought is incapacitated and that the appointment is necessary as a means of providing continuing care and supervision of the person of the incapacitated individual. The court, on appropriate findings, may:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> Treat the petition as a petition for a protective order under <a href='./21-2051.html'>section 21-2051</a> and proceed accordingly;</dd>

                <dd> The court, at the time of appointment, later on its own motion, or on appropriate petition or motion of the incapacitated individual or other interested person, may limit the powers of a guardian otherwise conferred by this chapter and create a limited guardianship. Any limitation on the statutory power of a guardian of an incapacitated individual shall be endorsed on the guardian's letters. Following the same procedure, a limitation may be removed or modified and appropriate letters issued.</dd>
