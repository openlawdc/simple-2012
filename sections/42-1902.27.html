                <dd> If there is no unit owner other than the declarant, the declarant may unilaterally amend the condominium instruments, and the amendment shall become effective upon recordation if the amendment has been executed by the declarant. This section shall not be construed to nullify, limit, or otherwise affect the validity or enforceability of any agreement renouncing or to renounce, in whole or in part, the right conferred by this section.</dd>

If none of the units in the condominium is restricted exclusively to residential use, the condominium instruments may specify a majority smaller than the minimum specified in the preceding sentence.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>

                <dt>d</dt>
                <dd> Any amendment to the condominium instruments required by this chapter to be recorded by the unit owners' association shall be prepared, executed, recorded, and certified on behalf of the unit owners' association by any officer designated for that purpose or, in the absence of designation, by the presiding officer of the executive board.</dd>

                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> Create or increase special declarant rights;</dd>

                <dt>4</dt>

                <dd> Change the uses to which any unit is restricted, in the absence of the unanimous consent of the unit owners.</dd>
            
                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd>(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, within 5 years after the recordation of a condominium instrument that contains or creates a mistake, inconsistency, error, or ambiguity, the declarant may unilaterally execute and record a corrective amendment or supplement to the condominium instruments to:</dd>
            
                <dt>A</dt>
                <dd> Correct a mathematical mistake, an inconsistency, or a scrivener's error; or</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> Clarify an ambiguity in the condominium instruments with respect to an objectively verifiable fact, including without limitation recalculating the undivided interest in the common elements, the liability for common expenses or right to surplus funds, or the number of votes in the unit owners' association that pertain to a unit.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> An amendment or supplement may not materially reduce what the obligations of the declarant would have been if the mistake, inconsistency, error, or ambiguity had not occurred. The principal officer of the unit owners' association may unilaterally execute and record a corrective amendment or supplement upon a vote of 2/3 of the members of the executive board. Any corrective amendment or supplement shall be validated to the extent that the corrective amendment or supplement would have been permitted by this subsection.</dd>
