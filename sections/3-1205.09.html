Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 18-26 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"(a)(1) A person licensed under this chapter to practice a health occupation is authorized to practice that occupation in the District while the license is effective.

"(2) A person certified to practice advanced registered nursing is authorized to practice the specialty for which he or she has been certified by the Board of Nursing.

"(b) An individual who fails to renew a license to practice a health occupation shall be considered to be unlicensed and subject to the penalties set forth in this chapter and other applicable laws of the District, if he or she continues to practice the health occupation."

D.C. Law 19-171 validated a previously made technical correction in the section heading.
