The court shall have jurisdiction to act upon the application at any time prior to the expiration of the minimum sentence and no hearing shall be required. If a prisoner is serving a sentence for a crime for which a minimum sentence is prescribed by § 24-403(b) his minimum sentence shall not be reduced under this section below the minimum sentence so prescribed.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., § 24-201c.\n\n1973 Ed., § 24-201c.\n\nDC CODE § 24-401c\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(July 17, 1947, 61 Stat. 379, ch. 263, § 4; June 29, 1953, 67 Stat. 92, ch. 159, § 201(b).)","sections":[],"division":{"identifier":"IV","text":"Criminal Law and Procedure and Prisoners."},"title":{"identifier":"24","text":"Prisoners and Their Treatment.
