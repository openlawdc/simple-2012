D.C. Law 17-353 designated the existing language as subsec. (a); in subsec. (a)(4)(C), substituted "this section" for "this subsection"; redesignated subsec. (a)(4)(D) as subsec. (b); and, in subsec. (b), substituted "subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of subsection (a)(4) of this section" for "subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph" and substituted " subsection (a)(4) of this section shall" for "this paragraph shall".

D.C. Law 18-26, in subsec. (a), rewrote the lead-in language and par. (3); and added par. (3)(A). Prior to amendment, the lead-in language and par. (3) of subsec. (a) read as follows:

"(3) To an individual, licensed to practice a health occupation in a state, who is called from the state in professional consultation by or on behalf of a specific patient to visit, examine, treat, or advise the specific patient in the District, or to give a demonstration or clinic in the District, provided that the individual engages in the consultation, demonstration, or clinic in affiliation with a comparable health professional licensed pursuant to this chapter;"
