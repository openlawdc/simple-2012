1973 Ed., <a href='./47-2331.html'>§ 47-2331</a>.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-38, in subsec. (h), substituted "an Inspected Sales and Services endorsement to a basic business license under the basic" for "a Class A Inspected Sales and Services endorsement to a master business license under the master".

D.C. Law 16-175 repealed subsec. (c), which had read as follows:

"(c) There is hereby imposed for the privilege of operating vehicles for hire having a seating capacity of more than 12 passengers in addition to the driver or operator, other than those licensed under subsection (b) of this section in the District of Columbia, a license tax of $150 per annum or $10 per day at the option of the operator. The license issued pursuant to this subsection shall be transferable between vehicles operated under the same ownership, management, operation, or control. No such vehicle shall be operated unless there shall be conspicuously displayed thereon a license issued under the terms of this subsection. Annual licenses required by this subsection shall be issued by the Department of Public Works."

D.C. Law 16-279, rewrote subsec. (a); repealed subsec. (c); and in subsec. (d), deleted the last sentence which had read as follows: "Annual licenses required by this subsection shall be issued by the Department of Public Works." Subsection (c), was previously repealed by Law 16-175. Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) read as follows:

"(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the District government shall not issue or reissue any license or permit to any applicant for a license or permit if the applicant owes more than $100 in outstanding debt to the District as a result of:

"(1) Fines, penalties, or interest assessed pursuant to Chapter 8 of Title 8;

"(2) Fines or penalties assessed pursuant to Chapter 9 of Title 8;

"(3) Fines, penalties, or interest assessed pursuant to Chapter 18 of Title 2;

"(4) Past due taxes;

"(5) Past due District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority service fees;

"(6) Fines or penalties assessed pursuant to Chapter 23 of Title 50;

"(7) Parking fines or penalties assessed by another jurisdiction; provided, that a reciprocity agreement is in effect between the jurisdiction and the District;

"(8) Fines assessed to car dealers pursuant to [<a href='./50-1501.02.html'>§ 50-1501.02(i)</a>];

"(9) Fines assessed to pursuant to the Taxicab and Limousine Commission Establishment Amendment Act of 2004, as approved by the Committee on Public Works and the Environment on December 6, 2004 (Committee print of Bill 15- 1085)."

D.C. Law 16-294 made a technical correction that resulted in no change in text.

D.C. Law 17-353 validated a previously made technical correction in the repeal of subsec. (c).

D.C. Law 18-111, in subsec. (e)(1), substituted "$75" for "$35" and "$200" for "$100"; and, in subsec. (i), substituted "$75" for "$5" and "$200" for "$100".
