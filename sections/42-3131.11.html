        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-307, in subsec. (a)(1), substituted "real properties, as identified on the cadastral maps of the Office of Tax and Revenue according to square, parcel, or reservation, and lot," for "building addresses"; and added subsec. (a)(3).

D.C. Law 16-24, in subsec. (a)(2), substituted "quarterly" for "semiannual".

D.C. Law 17-216 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"(a)(1) Within 30 days after April 27, 2001, the Mayor shall identify vacant buildings in the District and compile a list of real properties, as identified on the cadastral maps of the Office of Tax and Revenue according to square, parcel, or reservation, and lot, that includes the names and addresses of owners, if known.

"(2) The Mayor shall update this list on a semiannual basis.

"(3) Copies of the list prescribed by this section and updates shall be transmitted to the Chief Financial Officer in the form and medium prescribed by the Chief Financial Officer.

"(b) For buildings that are vacant buildings on the date of the Mayor's initial listing, the Mayor shall make a determination of delinquency of registration or fee payment within 45 days after April 27, 2001; shall provide the owner with the notice of the delinquency, the registration form, and the registration amount that is due; and shall inform the owner of the right to an administrative review of the determination.

"(c) For buildings that become vacant buildings after the date of the Mayor's initial list, the Mayor shall make a determination of delinquency of registration or fee payment within 15 days of the date of the quarterly listing and give the owner notice of the delinquency determination, the registration form and registration fee due, and the right to administrative review of the determination."
