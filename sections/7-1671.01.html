        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Legislative History of Laws

Law 18-210, the "Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Amendment Act of 2010", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 18-622, which was referred to the Committee on Health and the Committee on Public Safety and the Judiciary. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on April 20, 2010, and May 4, 2010, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on May 21, 2010, it was assigned Act No. 18-429 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 18-210 became effective on July 27, 2010.

Temporary Addition of Section

Section 2 of D.C. Law 18-152 added a section to read as follows:

"Sec. 11a. Applicability.

"This act shall apply upon the effective date of the Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative Amendment Act of 2010, as introduced on January 19, 2010 (D.C. Bill 18-622).".

Section 4(b) of D.C. Law 18-152 provides that the act shall expire after 225 days of its having taken effect.

Emergency Act Amendments

For temporary (90 day) addition, see § 2 of Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative Applicability Emergency Amendment Act of 2009 (D.C. Act 18-323, March 1, 2010, <a href='http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Gateway/IssueList.aspx?IssueYear=2010'>57 DCR 1849</a>).

Miscellaneous Notes

History of D.C. Law 13-315.

Initiative 59, permitting the use of marijuana for medical treatment, was certified as a proper subject for an initiative by the District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics on September 17, 1998. In reaction to the certification, Congress enacted and the President signed the "Barr Amendment" that prohibited the use of appropriated funds to conduct any ballot initiative which sought to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with a controlled substance. Since, the ballots for the November 3 election had already been printed before enactment of the Barr Amendment, District voters still considered the initiative.

After the vote, the Board of Elections and Ethics refused, in light of the Barr Amendment, to release and certify the results of the vote on Initiative 59. Certain District of Columbia voters then sued the Board.

In Turner v. District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics, 77 F.Supp.2d 25 (D.D.C. 1999), the court ruled that the Board could count and certify the election results concerning Initiative 59. After the count, the Board announced that Initiative 59 had been approved by the voters and certified the results. The initiative was eventually assigned D.C. Act 13-138.

On October 20, 1999, the District of Columbia Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") submitted a fiscal impact statement that found that implementation of Act 13- 138 would have a fiscal impact and recommended that the cost be included in the development of the fiscal year 2001 budget.

On October 25, 1999, the District of Columbia Council transmitted D.C. Act 13- 138 to the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority ("Control Board").

On October 26, 1999, the Control Board informed the Council that it would not accept D.C. Act 13-138 without a revised fiscal impact statement from the CFO.

On September 30, 2001, the Control Board suspended its activities.

Between 1998 and 2009 all District of Columbia appropriations acts contained language that prevented Initiative 59 from taking effect as law. Congress did not include the language in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2010 (<a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%20111-117'>Pub. L. 111-117</a>).

With the removal of the "Bar Amendment", the Council transmitted Act 13-138 to Congress on December 21, 2009, for a 30-day period of review.

Act 13-138 became D.C. Law 13-315 on February 25, 2010, and is published at <a href='http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Gateway/IssueList.aspx?IssueYear=2010'>57 DCR 3360</a>. D.C. Law 18-210 amended Law 13-315 in its entirety "to read as follows."

Establishment of Medical Marijuana Program Pursuant to the Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative of 1999, see Mayor's Order 2011-71, April 13, 2011 (<a href='http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Gateway/IssueList.aspx?IssueYear=2011'>58 DCR 3527</a>).
