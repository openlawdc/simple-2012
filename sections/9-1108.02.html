        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-360 repealed par. (3) which had read as follows:

"(3) Inclusion of the fiscal effect of this subchapter in an approved budget and financial plan."

D.C. Law 18-111, in the introductory text, substituted "Section 9-1108.01(b)" for "Section 9-1108.01"; and added par. (4).

Emergency Act Amendments

For temporary (90 day) amendment of section, see § 6071(b) of Fiscal Year 2010 Budget Support Second Emergency Act of 2009 (D.C. Act 18-207, October 15, 2009, 56 DCR 8234).

For temporary (90 day) amendment of section, see § 6071(b) of Fiscal Year Budget Support Congressional Review Emergency Amendment Act of 2009 (D.C. Act 18-260, January 4, 2010, 57 DCR 345).

Legislative History of Laws

For Law 16-132, see notes following § 9-1108.01.

For Law 17-360, see notes following § 9-1108.01.

For Law 18-111, see notes following § 9-1108.01.

Miscellaneous Notes

Section 3(3) of Law 16-132 required that the fiscal effect of Law 16-132 be included in an approved budget and financial plan in order for Law 16-132 to apply as law. The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of November 2, 2007, that the fiscal effect of Law 16-132 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 16-98, are not in effect.

Section 3(b) of D.C. Law 17-360 repealed section 3(3) of D.C. Law 16-132 and restored this section.
