Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-269 rewrote the section heading which formerly read: "Time of bringing complaint.", redesignated former subsec. (a) as subsec. (b); added subsec. (a); and, in subsec. (b), inserted "This section shall apply, as of August 16, 1984, to the establishment of paternity of a child for whom paternity has not been established or for whom a paternity action was brought but dismissed because a statute of limitations of less than 21 years was then in effect in the jurisdiction in which the action was brought."

D.C. Law 18-33 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:

"(a) A proceeding to determine parentage may be brought by the District of Columbia, a person whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated, a child's mother, putative father, guardian, legal or physical custodian, the IV-D agency, the person whose parentage is to be determined, if an adult, or a licensed child-placing agency.

"(b) Proceedings over which the Division has jurisdiction under D.C. Official Code, sec. 11-1101(3) and (11) to establish parentage and provide for the support of a child may be instituted after four months of pregnancy or at anytime until the child's twenty-first birthday. This section shall apply, as of August 16, 1984, to the establishment of paternity of a child for whom paternity has not been established or for whom a paternity action was brought but dismissed because a statute of limitations of less than 21 years was then in effect in the jurisdiction in which the action was brought."
