                <p>No execution shall issue upon nor shall any levy be made against any property of the estate under any judgment against a decedent or a personal representative. No claim (which is not by its terms secured) shall attach to any particular estate asset, real or personal, whether in the hands of the personal representative or of any bona fide purchaser, or to the proceeds from the sale of any such asset. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to prevent the enforcement of mortgages, deeds of trust, pledges, liens, or other security interests upon property in an appropriate proceeding.</p>
