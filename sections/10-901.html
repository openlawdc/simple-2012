Legislative History of Laws

Law 8-96, the "Disposal of District Owned Surplus Real Property Amendment Act of 1989," was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 8-302, which was referred to the Committee on Government Operations. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on November 21, 1989, and December 19, 1989, respectively. Approved without the signature of the Mayor on January 18, 1990, it was assigned Act No. 8-148 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review.

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402 (193) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, § 711 (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.11.html'>§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.14.html'>§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.

Transfer of Functions

The functions, powers and duties of the National Capital Park and Planning Commission were transferred to the National Capital Planning Commission by the Act of June 6, 1924, ch. 270, § 9, as added by the Act of July 19, 1952, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=66&page=790'>66 Stat. 790</a>, ch. 949, § 1.
