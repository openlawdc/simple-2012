Miscellaneous Notes

Section 1203 of D.C. Law 18-371 provides that this section shall apply upon the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan.

The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of February 15, 2012, that the fiscal effect of section 803 Law 18-371 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 18-371, are not in effect.
