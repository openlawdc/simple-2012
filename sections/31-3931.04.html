        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-286 rewrote this section, which formerly read:

"(a) A captive insurer may form one or more segregated accounts to insure risks of one or more participants.

"(b) A captive insurer that maintains a segregated account shall, at the time of paying the annual fee, pay an additional annual fee in an amount to be established by the Commissioner for each segregated account.

"(c) A captive insurer may create one or more segregated accounts to segregate its assets and liabilities from the assets and liabilities of its segregated accounts. The assets and liabilities of each segregated account shall be held separately from the assets and liabilities of all other segregated accounts.

"(d) A captive insurer shall be a single legal entity and each segregated account of or within a captive insurer may be established as a separate legal entity, which shall constitute a legal entity separate from the captive insurer. Each segregated account shall be separately identified or designated as being a part of the captive insurer.

''(e) A captive insurer may create and issue shares in one or more classes or series for one or more segregated accounts. The proceeds of the issue shall be included in the assets of the segregated account that issued the shares.

"(f) The proceeds of the issue of shares, other than segregated account shares, shall be included in the captive insurer's general assets.

"(g) A captive insurer may pay a dividend on segregated account shares of any class or series whether or not a dividend is declared on any other class or series of segregated account shares, or any other shares.

"(h) Segregated account dividends may be paid on the segregated account shares from the segregated account assets. The dividends shall only be paid to the shareholders of the segregated account from which the segregated account shares were issued and otherwise in accordance with the rights of the shares.

"(i) Any act, matter, deed, agreement, contract, instrument under seal, or other instrument or arrangement which is to be binding on or to inure to the benefit of a segregated account or accounts shall be executed by the captive insurer for and on behalf of such segregated account or accounts, shall be identified, and, if in writing, shall indicate that the execution is in the name of, or by or for the account of, the segregated account or accounts.

"(j) If a captive insurer is in breach of subsection (i) of this section:

"(1) The directors of the captive insurer shall, notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the captive insurer's organizational documents or in any contract with the company or otherwise, incur personal liability for the liabilities of the captive insurer and the segregated account under this chapter, matter, deed, agreement, contract, instrument, or arrangement that was executed; and

"(2) Unless they were fraudulent, reckless, negligent, or acted in bad faith, the directors of the captive insurer shall have a right of indemnity:

"(A) In the case of a matter on behalf of or attributable to a segregated account or accounts; against the assets of that account or accounts.

"(B) In the case of a matter not on behalf of or attributable to any segregated account or accounts, against the general assets of the captive insurer.

"(k) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (j)(1) of this section, a court may relieve a director of all or part of this personal liability thereunder if he or she satisfies the court that he or she should be relieved because:

"(1) The director was not aware of the circumstances giving rise to the liability and, in being not so aware, the director was not fraudulent, reckless, or negligent, and did not act in bad faith; or

"(2) The director expressly objected, and exercised his or her rights as a director, whether by way of voting power or otherwise, so as to try to prevent the circumstances giving rise to the liability.

"(l) If, pursuant to the provisions of subsection (k) of this section, the court relieves a director of all or part of his or her personal liability under subsection (j)(1) of this section, the court may order that the liability in question shall instead be met from such of the segregated account or general assets of the account of the captive insurer as may be specified in the order.

"(m) Any provision in the organizational documents of a captive insurer, or any other contractual provision under which the captive insurer may be liable, which purports to indemnify directors in respect of conduct which would otherwise disentitle them to an indemnity by virtue of subsection (j)(2) of this section, shall be void.

"(n) The assets of a captive insurer shall be either segregated account assets or general assets. The segregated account assets shall comprise the assets of the captive insurer held within or on behalf of the segregated accounts of the captive insurer. The general assets of a captive insurer shall comprise the assets of the captive insurer which are not segregated account assets.

"(o) The assets of a segregated account are comprised of assets representing the capital stock and reserves attributable to the segregated account or all other assets attributable to or held within the segregated account. For the purposes of this subsection, 'reserves' includes retained earnings, capital surplus, and paid-in capital.

"(p) The directors of a captive insurer shall establish and maintain, or cause to be established and maintained, procedures:

"(1) To segregate, and keep segregated, account assets separate and separately identifiable from general assets;

"(2) To segregate, and keep segregated, account assets of each segregated account separate and separately identifiable from segregated account assets of any other segregated account; and

"(3) If relevant, to apportion or transfer assets and liabilities between segregated accounts, or between segregated accounts and general assets, of the segregated account captive insurer.

"(q) Segregated account assets shall:

"(1) Only be available and used to meet liabilities of the creditors with respect to that segregated account, and those creditors shall thereby be entitled to have recourse to the segregated account assets attributable to that segregated account; and

"(2) Not be available or used to meet liabilities to, and shall be absolutely protected from, the creditors of the captive insurer who are not creditors with respect to a particular segregated account, and those creditors shall not be entitled to have recourse to the protected segregated account assets.

"(r) If a liability of a captive insurer to a person arises from a matter, or is otherwise imposed, with respect to a particular segregated account, the liability shall extend only to, and that person shall, with respect to that liability, be entitled to have recourse only to:

"(1) First, the segregated account assets attributable to the segregated account; and

"(2) Second, the captive insurer's general assets, to the extent that the segregated account assets attributable to the segregated account, are insufficient to satisfy the liability, and to the extent that the captive insurer's general assets exceed any minimum capital amounts lawfully required by this chapter.

"(s) If a liability of a captive insurer to a person arises otherwise than from a matter in respect of a particular segregated account or accounts, or is imposed otherwise than in respect of a particular segregated account or accounts, the liability shall extend only to, and that person shall, with respect to that liability, be entitled to have recourse only to the captive insurer's general assets.

"(t) Liabilities of a captive insurer not attributable to any of its segregated accounts shall be discharged from the account captive insurer's general assets. Income, receipts, and other property or rights of or acquired by a captive insurer not otherwise attributable to any segregated account shall be attributed to the captive insurer's general assets to the extent that the captive insurer's general assets exceed any minimum capital amounts lawfully required by this chapter.

"(u)(1) Each segregated account shall be accounted for separately on the books and records of the captive insurer to reflect the financial condition and results of operations of the segregated account, including net income or loss, dividends, or other distributions to participants, and such other factors as may be provided by the participant contract or required by the Commissioner.

"(2) No sale, exchange, or other transfer of assets shall be made by the captive insurer between or among any of its segregated accounts without the written consent of the segregated accounts and the Commissioner.

"(3) No sale, exchange, transfer of assets, dividend, or distribution shall be made from a segregated account to any person without the Commissioner's prior written approval and the approval shall not be given if the sale, exchange, transfer, dividend, or distribution would result in the insolvency or impairment with respect to the segregated account.

"(4) Each segregated account captive insurer shall annually file with the Commissioner such financial reports as the Commissioner shall require, which shall include financial statements detailing the financial experience of each segregated account.

"(5) Each captive insurer shall notify the Commissioner within 10 business days of any segregated account that is insolvent or otherwise unable to meet its claims or expense obligations.

"(6) No participant contract shall take effect without the Commissioner's prior written approval. The addition of each new segregated account or the withdrawal of any participant from any existing segregated account shall constitute a change in the strategic business plan of that segregated account requiring the Commissioner's prior written approval.

"(v) Any person or legal entity may be a participant in a segregated account formed or licensed under this chapter.

"(w) A participant in a segregated account need not be a shareholder insured within the segregated account or by the captive insurer or any affiliate thereof."
