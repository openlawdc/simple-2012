                <p>A board may suspend the license, registration, or certification of a person during any time that the person is incarcerated after conviction of a felony or misdemeanor, regardless of whether the conviction has been appealed. A board, immediately upon receipt of a certified copy of a record of a criminal conviction, shall notify the person in writing at that person's address of record with the board, and at the facility in which the person is incarcerated, of the suspension and that the person has a right to request a hearing. If requested, the hearing shall be held within 6 months of the release of the licensee, registrant, or person certified.</p>
