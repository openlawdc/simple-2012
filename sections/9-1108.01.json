Act 18-207, October 15, 2009, 56 DCR 8234).\n\nFor temporary (90 day) amendment of section, see §§ 6071(a), 7032 of Fiscal Year Budget Support Congressional Review Emergency Amendment Act of 2009 (D.C. Act 18-260, January 4, 2010, 57 DCR 345).\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nLaw 16-132, the \"Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Fund Act of 2006\", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 16-569 which was referred to the Committee on Finance and Revenue. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on March 7, 2006, and April 4, 2006, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on April 21, 2006, it was assigned Act No. 16-350 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 16-132 became effective on June 16, 2006.\n\nLaw 17-360, the \"Limitation on Borrowing and Establishment of the Operating Cash Reserve Act of 2008\", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 17- 914 which was referred to the Committee of the Whole. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on December 2, 2008, and December 16, 2008, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on January 16, 2009, it was assigned Act No. 17-695 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C.

The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of November 2, 2007, that the fiscal effect of Law 16-132 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 16-98, are not in effect.\n\nSection 3(b) of D.C. Law 17-360 repealed section 3(3) of D.C. Law 16-132 and restored this section.\n\nShort title: Section 6070 of D.C.
