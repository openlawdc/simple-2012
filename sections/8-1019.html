                <dd> Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, beginning on January 1, 1994, if any person, including any partnership, corporation, or association, sells or distributes a significant quantity of a paper or paper product, subject to this section, in the District of Columbia ("District"), the paper or paper product shall contain in the aggregate for the calendar year at least the minimum percentage of recycled content designated in this section or in the rules issued, or amended, by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") pursuant to § 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, approved October 21, 1976 (90 Stat. 2822; 42 U.S.C. § 6962), and set forth in 40 CFR 250.21 (Table 1).</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> For the purposes of this section, the phrase "significant quantity" of a paper or paper product means an average per-issue circulation of at least 30,000 copies, an annual weight of at least 500 tons, or annual gross receipts of at least $100,000 from the sale or distribution of a paper or paper product. The phrase "paper or paper product subject to this section" means any paper or paper product selected by the EPA for inclusion in the table set forth in subsection (c) of this section. If the EPA finds insufficient production of a particular paper or paper product with recycled content to assure adequate competition, the paper or paper product shall not be subject to this section.</dd>

                <dt>e</dt>
                <dd> The Mayor shall publish notice in the District of Columbia Register within 30 days after any amendment by the EPA to 40 CFR subsection 250.21 (Table 1) regarding the minimum recycled content requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section. Any amendment to the table shall also be published in the District of Columbia Official Code.</dd>

                <dd> Notwithstanding the date for compliance with the recycled content percentage requirements set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the dates for compliance with the recycled content percentage requirement for newsprint shall be as follows:</dd>

                <dd> 12% for calendar year ("CY") 1992;</dd>

                <dd> However, in the year following any year in which the Mayor determines, based on the reports submitted under § 8-1020, that the required recycled content percentages for newsprint for the previous year were not achieved in the aggregate on a District-wide basis, then each person subject to this section shall meet the required percentages.</dd>
