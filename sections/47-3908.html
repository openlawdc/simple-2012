1981 Ed., § 47-3908.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-217 rewrote subsecs. (a) and (b); and, in subsec. (c), substituted "Except as provided in <a href='./47-4312.html'>§ 47-4312</a>, any person aggrieved by an assessment of a deficiency in tax" for "Any person aggrieved by an assessment of a deficiency in tax finally determined by the Mayor". Prior to amendment, subsecs. (a) and (b) had read as follows:

"(a) The Mayor shall have the authority to determine, redetermine, assess, or reassess any tax due under this chapter. If a deficiency in tax is determined by the Mayor, the person liable for the deficiency shall be notified of the determination of a deficiency by certified mail sent to the person's last known address. The notice shall state that a protest may be filed with the Mayor not more than 30 days after the date that the notice is certified as having been mailed and shall explain that the protest is an opportunity to show cause why the deficiency should not be paid. If no protest is filed within the 30-day period, the deficiency as determined by the Mayor shall be final. If a protest is filed within the 30-day period, the Mayor shall provide an opportunity for a hearing concerning the matter and shall send notice of a final decision and a statement of taxes finally determined to be due, by mail, to the last known address of the person liable for the payment of the deficiency.

"(b) Any deficiency in tax that has become final under subsection (a) of this section shall be due and payable, if no protest is filed, within 10 days after the end of the 30-day period described in subsection (a) of this section. If a protest is filed, the deficiency shall be due and payable within 10 days after notice of the Mayor's final decision concerning the protest is mailed to the person liable for the deficiency."
