Nothing contained within this subsection shall be construed as granting a similar right to terminate or repudiate to either the transferor or the distributor.</dd>
            
                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd>(1) Upon the death or retirement of a retail dealer, the distributor shall grant a 1-year trial marketing agreement in the name of a successor who has been designated by the retail dealer and approved by the distributor. The designated successors shall be limited to a retail dealer's spouse, adult children, adult stepchildren, and the approval of the designated successor by the distributor shall not be unreasonably withheld.</dd>

The distributor shall approve or disapprove the designated successor, in writing, within 60 days after receipt of the written designation notice. A distributor's failure to notify a retail dealer of the approval or disapproval of any designated successor shall be construed as an approval of the designated successor.</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> A 1-year trial marketing agreement shall contain the same terms and conditions as were contained in the marketing agreement in effect prior to the retail dealer's death or retirement. Pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter, a successor dealer, with the approval of the distributor, may sell, assign, or otherwise transfer the trial marketing agreement granted under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</dd>
