Legislative History of Laws

Law 18-311, the "Samuel J. Simmons NCBA Estates No. 1 Limited Partnership Real Property Tax Exemption and Equitable Real Property Tax Relief Act of 2010", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 18-558, which was referred to the Committee on Finance and Revenue. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on November 9, 2010, and November 23, 2010, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on December 9, 2010, it was assigned Act No. 18-632 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 18-311 became effective on March 12, 2011.

Miscellaneous Notes

Sections 3 and 4 of D.C. Law 18-311 provides:

"Sec. 3. Sunset.

"This act shall expire 360 months after its effective date.

"Sec. 4. Applicability.

"This act shall apply upon the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan."

The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of February 15, 2012, that the fiscal effect of Law 18-311 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 18-311, are not in effect.

Section 7003 of D.C. Law 19-168 repealed section 4 of D.C. Law 18-311.
