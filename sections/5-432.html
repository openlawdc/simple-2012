        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 19-21, in subsec. (a), substituted "lapsing" for "nonlapsing, revolving"; and repealed subsec. (c), which had read as follows:

"(c) All monies deposited in the Fund shall be appropriated without fiscal year limitation pursuant to an act of Congress. Excluding monies collected in the current year, any money deposited in the Fund in the year prior to the current year and the interest earned on that money remaining in the Fund after the payment of the costs accrued in the prior year, less 10% of the remainder amount that shall be retained as a reserve operating balance, shall be transferred or revert to the General Fund of the District of Columbia."
