1981 Ed., § 19-112.

1973 Ed., <a href='./19-112.html'>§ 19-112</a>.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-292 deleted ", and his or her dower rights" following "decedent's estate".

D.C. Law 16-79 rewrote section which had read as follows:

"Subject to <a href='./19-114.html'>section 19-114</a>, and unless it is otherwise expressed in the will, a devise of real estate or an interest therein, or a bequest of personal estate or an interest therein, to the surviving spouse, bars his or her share in the decedent's estate."

D.C. Law 16-191, in the section credit for D.C. Law 13-292, validated a previously made technical correction.
