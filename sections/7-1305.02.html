Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-199 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"Customers shall be provided with the least restrictive and most normal living conditions possible. This standard shall apply to dress, grooming, movement, use of free time, and contact and communication with the community, including access to services outside of the institution or residential facility. Customers shall be taught skills that help them learn how to effectively utilize their environment and how to make choices necessary for daily living."

D.C. Law 19-169 substituted "Individuals" for "Customers", "with intellectual disabilities" for "with mental retardation", and "individual's intellectual disability" for "individual's mental retardation".
