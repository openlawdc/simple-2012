                <p>If an arbitrator makes a preaward ruling in favor of a party to the arbitration proceeding, the party may request the arbitrator to incorporate the ruling into an award under <a href='./16-4419.html'>§ 16-4419</a>. A prevailing party may make a motion to the court for an expedited order to confirm the award under <a href='./16-4422.html'>§ 16-4422</a>, in which case the court shall summarily decide the motion. The court shall issue an order to confirm the award unless the court vacates, modifies, or corrects the award under <a href='./16-4423.html'>§ 16-4423</a> or 16-4424.</p>
