        <h1>§ 16-4418 Judicial enforcement of preaward ruling by arbitrator.</h1>
        
            
                <p>If an arbitrator makes a preaward ruling in favor of a party to the arbitration proceeding, the party may request the arbitrator to incorporate the ruling into an award under § 16-4419. A prevailing party may make a motion to the court for an expedited order to confirm the award under § 16-4422, in which case the court shall summarily decide the motion. The court shall issue an order to confirm the award unless the court vacates, modifies, or corrects the award under § 16-4423 or 16-4424.</p>
