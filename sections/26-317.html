Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-42, in subsec. (a), deleted the sentence: "An additional verification, handling, and documentation processing fee may be charged, pursuant to § 26-319, for a personal check held for deferred deposit."

D.C. Law 18-315 rewrote subsec. (a), which had read as follows:

"(a) No licensee under this chapter shall directly or indirectly charge or collect in fees or charges for cashing a check a sum to exceed 5% of the face value of a government or payroll check, 7% of the face value of an insurance check, 10% of the face value of a personal check or money order, or $4, whichever is greater. Each licensee shall conspicuously post, in both English and Spanish, and at all times display in every location and upon every mobile unit licensed under this chapter, a schedule of fees and charges permitted hereunder, which schedule shall be approved by the Superintendent prior to posting."
