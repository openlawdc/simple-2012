D.C. Law 18-111 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:

"(a)(1) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the Mayor shall submit to the Council by September 15 of each year, beginning in 2008, projected benchmarks by which to measure annual achievements within District of Columbia Public Schools.

"(2)(A) The Mayor shall submit to the Council by September 30 of each year, beginning in 2008, an annual evaluation of District of Columbia Public Schools that includes an assessment of:

"(i) Business practices;

"(ii) Human resources operations;

"(iii) All academic plans; and

"(iv) The annual achievements made as measured against the benchmarks submitted the previous year in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection, including a detailed description of student achievements.

"(B) For the 2008 evaluation, for which benchmarks would not have been submitted in the prior year, the annual achievements shall be measured using existing, reliable data and that data shall be included, or an abstract thereof, in the evaluation.

"(b) On September 15, 2012, in lieu of the annual evaluation required by subsection (a) of this section, the Mayor shall submit to the Council a 5-year assessment of the public education system established by this act, which shall include:

"(1) A comprehensive evaluation of public education following the passage of this act; and

"(2) A determination as to whether sufficient progress in public education has been achieved to warrant continuation of the provisions and requirements of this act or whether a new law, and a new system of education, should be enacted by the District government.

"(c)(1) The evaluations required by this section shall be conducted by an independent evaluator that shall be recommended by the Mayor and submitted to the Council for approval by September 15, 2007, for a 30-day review period.

"(2) If the Council does not approve or disapprove the recommendation, by resolution, within the 30-day review period, the recommendation shall be deemed disapproved.

"(3) The evaluations required by this section may be conducted by the same independent evaluator for 5 consecutive years.

"(4) For the purposes of this subsection, the term 'independent evaluator' means an individual or entity that has neither a current contractual or employment relationship with the District government."
