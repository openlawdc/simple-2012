                <p>If a holder disclaims a power of appointment or other power not held in a fiduciary capacity, the following rules apply:</p>
            
        

        
        <dl>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> If the holder has not exercised the power, the disclaimer takes effect as of the time the instrument creating the power becomes irrevocable.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> If the holder has exercised the power and the disclaimer is of a power other than a presently exercisable general power of appointment, the disclaimer takes effect immediately after the last exercise of the power.</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> The instrument creating the power is construed as if the power expired when the disclaimer became effective.</dd>
            
        </dl>
