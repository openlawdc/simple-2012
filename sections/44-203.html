Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-33, in subsec. (b), substituted "a person shall meet the applicable qualifications as specified in rules issued pursuant to §44-213 and shall: " for "a person shall meet: "; in subsec. (e), substituted "5" for "2"; and rewrote subsec. (d), which had read as follows:

"(d) The laboratory director shall be present for a reasonable period of each working day in each clinical laboratory for which he or she is director. If the laboratory director cannot be present on a short-term basis for a period of time to be determined by the Mayor, the laboratory director shall designate, in writing, a substitute laboratory director who meets the qualifications of subsection (b) of this section."

D.C. Law 16-191, in subsec. (b), validated a previously made technical correction.
