1981 Ed., § 40-208.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-235 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"As used in this chapter the term 'motor vehicle' means all vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines, electricity, or steam. The term 'motor vehicle' shall not include traction engines, road rollers, vehicles propelled only upon rails or tracks, and battery-operated wheelchairs when operated by a handicapped person at speeds not exceeding 10 miles per hour."

D.C. Law 15-105 validated a previously made technical correction.

D.C. Law 16-224 revived the provisions of D.C. Law 14-235 that expired on October 1, 2005, and substituted "personal assistive mobility devices, as defined by <a href='./50-2201.02.html'>§ 50-2201.02(12)</a>, or a battery-operated wheelchair when operated by a person with a disability" for "electric personal assistive mobility devices, as defined by <a href='./50-2201.02.html'>§ 50-2201.02(12)</a>, and battery-operated wheelchairs when operated by a handicapped person at speeds not exceeding 10 miles per hour".

D.C. Law 16-305 purported to substitute "person with a disability" for "handicapped person".
