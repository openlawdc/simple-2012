Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-33 rewrote section, which had read as follows:

"(a) A clinical laboratory shall employ a clinical laboratory technologist. A clinical laboratory technologist shall perform clinical laboratory tests with minimal supervision by the laboratory director while working in those areas in which he or she is qualified by education or experience. To qualify as a clinical laboratory technologist, a person shall hold a baccalaureate degree in medical technology or in a chemical, physical, or biological science and have at least one year of clinical laboratory experience or training acceptable to the Mayor.

"(b) Technical personnel below the level of technologist shall be determined by the laboratory director to be fully qualified for all assigned technical duties. The bases for the determination shall be maintained in writing in the clinical laboratory's personnel files. The technical personnel shall have clinical laboratory training that complies with the rules issued pursuant to this chapter."
