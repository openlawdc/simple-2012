Statutory provisions for the National Training School for Girls were formerly codified in D.C. Code, §<a href='./32-901.html'>§ 32-901</a> to 32-913. These provisions were omitted from codification as obsolete in the 1973 Edition of the D.C. Code in light of the Act of August 3, 1951, 62 Stat. 154, ch. 291, § 1, which provided that no new commitments to the School should be made after August 3, 1951.
