        <h1>§ 16-3904 Set-off or counterclaim; pleading; retention of jurisdiction.</h1>
        
            
                <p>If the defendant in an action pursuant to this chapter, asserts a set-off or counterclaim, the judge may require a formal plea of set-off to be filed, or may waive the requirement. If the plaintiff requires time to prepare his defense against the counterclaim or set-off, the judge may continue the case for that purpose. When the set-off or counterclaim is for more than the jurisdictional limit of the Small Claims and Conciliation Branch, as provided by <a href='./11-1321.html'>section 11-1321</a>, but within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, the action shall nevertheless remain in the Branch and be tried therein in its entirety.</p>
