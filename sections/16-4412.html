                <dd> An arbitrator has a continuing obligation to disclose to all parties to the agreement to arbitrate and arbitration proceeding, and to any other arbitrators, any facts that the arbitrator learns after accepting appointment which a reasonable person would consider likely to affect the impartiality of the arbitrator.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> If an arbitrator discloses a fact required by subsection (a) or (b) of this section to be disclosed and a party timely objects to the appointment or continued service of the arbitrator based upon the fact disclosed, the objection may be a ground under <a href='./16-4423.html'>§ 16-4423(a)(2)</a> for vacating an award made by the arbitrator.</dd>
            
                <dt>d</dt>
