If 2 or more parties survive and none is the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner of the decedent, the amount to which the decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled under section 19-602.11 belongs to the surviving parties in equal shares, and augments the proportion to which each survivor, immediately before the decedent's death, was beneficially entitled under section 19-602.11, and the right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties."},{"prefix":"b","text":" In an account with a POD designation:"},{"prefix":"1","text":" On death of one of 2 or more parties, the rights in sums on deposit are governed by subsection (a) of this section."},{"prefix":"2","text":" On death of the sole party or the last survivor of 2 or more parties, sums on deposit belong to the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries.
