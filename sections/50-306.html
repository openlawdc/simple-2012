Designation of District of Columbia Taxicab Commission Panel on Rates and Rules and Panel on Consumer and Industry Concerns: See Mayor's Order 97-64, April 2, 1997 (44 DCR 2176).

Law 19-184 amended this section only "upon the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan, as certified by the Chief Financial Officer to the Budget Director of the Council in a certification published by the Council in the District of Columbia Register." As of the most recent updated publication of this section, the certification required for Law 19-184 has not been made. Therefore the amendments have not been incorporated into this section.
