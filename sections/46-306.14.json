A party who obtains the order and fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises. The failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the modified order of the new tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., § 30-346.14.\n\nTemporary Amendments of Sections\n\nFor temporary (225 day) amendment of section, see § 7(a) of Child Support and Welfare Reform Compliance Temporary Amendment Act of 1998 (D.C.
