(c), substituted \"Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of Title 29\" for \"Chapter 1 of Title 29\".\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nLaw 18-378, the \"District of Columbia Official Code Title 29 (Business Organizations) Enactment Act of 2009\", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 18-500, which was referred to the Committee on Public Services and Consumer Affairs. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on December 7, 2010, and December 21, 2010, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on February 27, 2011, it was assigned Act No. 18-724 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 18-378 became effective on July 2, 2011.\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nDC CODE § 42-1218\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Aug. 3, 1954, 68 Stat. 650, ch. 653, § 1; July 2, 2011, D.C.
