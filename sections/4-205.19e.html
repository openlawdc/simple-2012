                <dd> Notwithstanding subsections (c), (d), or (e) of this section, the Mayor shall sanction a TANF recipient if the recipient quits paid employment without good cause or voluntarily reduces income without good cause within 60 days before the determination of eligibility for TANF or during the period in which the recipient receives TANF.</dd>
