Unless required to hold a hearing pursuant to subsection (i) of this section, the Court shall make its determination that the appointment of the standby guardian is in the best interest of the child based upon:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> The facts set forth in the petition; and</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>

                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> If requested in the petition, the Court may also approve an alternate standby guardian, identified by the designator, to act as the standby guardian if the current or originally designated standby guardian repudiates the designation, becomes incapacitated, or dies.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> The order shall provide that, subject to restoration of the designator's ability to parent as provided in <a href='./16-4804.html'>§ 16-4804(b)</a>, the authority of the standby guardian to act as legal custodian of the child shall be effective upon the Court's receipt of, or immediately if the Court is in receipt of, one of the following documents:</dd>

                <dt>d</dt>
                <dd> Unless it appears on the face of the petition that requirements of this chapter have not been met, the Court shall grant the petition within 120 days of the filing of the petition, or within 20 days of the filing of proof of notice having been served on parties required to be served pursuant to <a href='./16-4808.html'>§ 16- 4808</a>, whichever occurs first. If the requirements of this chapter have not been met, the Court shall not dismiss the petition, but shall issue an order to the petitioner to appear in court within 30 days of issuance of the order to remedy the deficiencies in the petition or to show cause why the petition should be granted notwithstanding the deficiencies.</dd>
            
                <dt>e</dt>
