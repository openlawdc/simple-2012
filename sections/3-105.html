Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-302 rewrote the section which had read:

"If the Commission recommends a system of sentencing guidelines as part of its report, any such recommendation shall:

"(1) Specify whether and under what circumstances to impose a sentence of probation, a term of imprisonment, and a fine, and the amount or length of each;

"(2) Provide for the application of intermediate sanctions in appropriate cases;

"(3) Include provisions for such appeal rights from sentencing determinations as may be appropriate or constitutionally required."

D.C. Law 15-190 added subsec. (e).

D.C. Law 17-25 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"(a) The Commission shall submit to the Council in the 2002 annual report a survey of the various types of structured sentencing systems in use in the United States and the Commission's recommendations as to which system would best serve the District of Columbia. The Commission shall also submit recommendations for the classification or ranking of criminal offenses in the District of Columbia.

"(b) The Court shall collect and provide to the Commission data on the length of and reasons for each sentence imposed for crimes committed on or after August 5, 2000. The reasons should include, but are not limited to, the weight given to such factors as the background and criminal history of the offender, the nature of the offense, and the impact of the offense on the victim or community. The data shall not become a part of the record and shall not be used to challenge the sentence imposed.

"(c) The Commission shall analyze the data provided to it by the Court and shall submit to the Council in the 2002 annual report:

"(1) An interim assessment on the implementation of the determinate sentencing system; and

"(2) An assessment of sentencing practices within the District of Columbia for August 5, 1996 to August 5, 2000.

"(d) The Commission shall submit to the Council in its 2003 annual report a recommendation for a comprehensive structured sentencing system in the District of Columbia or, in the alternative, a detailed explanation as to why the District of Columbia does not need a structured sentencing system. The Commission shall continue to analyze the data specified in subsections (b) and (c) of this section and submit a final report of its findings in its 2003 annual report to the Council.

"(e) The Commission shall assist the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in implementing, as a pilot program, the comprehensive structured sentencing system that was recommended by the Commission pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. No later than December 1, 2006, the Commission shall submit to the Council its final recommendation on the comprehensive structured sentencing system."
