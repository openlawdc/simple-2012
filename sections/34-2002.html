        <dl>
            
                <dt>a</dt>
                <dd> The Public Service Commission may, upon petition by the incumbent local exchange carrier and pursuant to procedures developed by the PSC, reclassify any telecommunications service offered by the incumbent local exchange carrier.</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> Pursuant to the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104- 104), the Public Service Commission shall establish a procedure to facilitate entry into the District for providers of all forms of telecommunications service in order to foster the availability of competitive telecommunications options to consumers in the District, and to encourage the development of a technological infrastructure which will afford District residents increased access to the information highway.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> The procedure established by the Public Service Commission shall provide that local exchange carriers will be regulated according to each LEC's respective market power in the local exchange market, and in such manner as to prohibit abuse of monopoly power and facilitate adjustments in pricing as developing competition dictates a need for market flexibility.</dd>
            
                <dt>d</dt>
                <dd>(1) The Public Service Commission, in lieu of requiring a certificate of public convenience and necessity, shall grant any telecommunications service provider seeking to provide services within the District the authority to do so within 15 days of an applicant's filing with the Commission of a Statement of Business Operations, as described in subsection (e) of this section, and the payment of an application fee of $1000. The provider shall be exempt from any other certification requirements if the applicant demonstrates in its Statement of Business Operations that it or its affiliates have at least three years experience providing telecommunications services pursuant to authorizations by the FCC or a state regulatory body and that it or its affiliates derives over $50 million in gross annual revenues from telecommunications services.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> Any telecommunications service provider possessing a certificate of convenience and public necessity to operate within the District of Columbia as of September 9, 1996 is exempted from the requirements in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> For applicants other than those meeting the criteria set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection, subsequent to the applicant's filing of the Statement of Business Operations as described in subsection (e) of this section, and the payment of an application fee of $1000, the Commission may request additional information to determine whether the applicant has sufficient experience and financial stability to ensure the continued provision of local exchange services within the District. For such applicants, the Commission may waive the minimum experience and gross annual revenue requirements if it can determine that certification is in the public interest and that the applicant has sufficient experience and financial stability to ensure the continued provision of local exchange services within the District.</dd>
            
                <dt>A</dt>
                <dd> If the PSC requests additional information from the applicant, such request must be provided in writing within 15 days of the applicant's filing.</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> The applicant shall be afforded 15 days to provide the additional information requested by the PSC.</dd>
            
                <dt>C</dt>
                <dd> Upon receipt of the additional information from the applicant, the PSC must determine within 15 days whether the additional information satisfies the PSC in respect to the applicant's ability to ensure continued provision of telecommunication services to District consumers.</dd>
            
                <dt>D</dt>
                <dd> If the PSC determines that the additional information provides the necessary assurances, the PSC shall authorize the applicant to provide services within the District of Columbia; if the Commission determines that the applicant has not demonstrated sufficient experience and financing, the applicant shall be provided written notice of the deficiency.</dd>
            
                <dt>e</dt>
                <dd> The Statement of Business Operations required by this section shall contain, at a minimum, the following information of each telecommunications service provider:</dd>

                <dt>6</dt>
                <dd> A signed tax attestation form;</dd>
            
                <dt>7</dt>
                <dd> A brief description of the type of service to be offered;</dd>

                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd> All local exchange carriers authorized by the PSC to provide service within the District must file and maintain tariffs with the Public Service Commission for each service offered within the District. The tariffs shall describe the service being offered, list all terms and conditions, and specify the rate or rates charged for the service.</dd>
            
                <dt>g</dt>
                <dd> Tariffs of competitive telecommunications service providers shall not be regulated or otherwise reviewed by the Public Service Commission, except as otherwise specified in subsection (h) of this section, for interconnection, and in § 34-2003 for Universal Service Trust Fund subsidies. Tariffs filed by competitive telecommunications providers shall be deemed just and reasonable. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the Public Service Commission shall not regulate, fix, or prescribe the tolls, charges, rate structure, terms and conditions of service, rate base, rate of return, operating margin, earnings, cost of service, or the issuance of debt, equity, or other securities of any competitive telecommunications service provider, except that nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the PSC to establish service quality standards for such telecommunications service providers, to regulate terms and conditions of service (but not including rates, charges, and rate structure) to protect the public safety and welfare, provide for continued quality of telecommunications service, and safeguard the rights of consumers.</dd>
            
                <dt>h</dt>
                <dd> All local exchange carriers in the District are required to unbundle network elements to the extent that federal law requires, and to interconnect networks and exchange local exchange service calls under terms that are reasonable and efficient.</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> All LECs shall reciprocally terminate each other's local exchange service calls and shall financially compensate each other for this service if the PSC determines that a traffic imbalance exists. As between any two LECs, if at any time after implementation of local number portability pursuant to this chapter the traffic terminated by one provider, on a quarterly basis, is at least 5% greater than the traffic terminated by the other provider, the two affected LECs shall mutually negotiate an agreement regarding the charges, terms, and conditions for the termination of local exchange service calls that originate on their respective networks.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> Any agreement adopted pursuant to this subsection shall be submitted for approval to the PSC. The PSC shall approve or reject the agreement, with written findings as to any deficiencies. If the PSC does not act to approve or reject the agreement within 90 days after submission by the LECs, the agreement shall be deemed approved. The PSC shall make a copy of each agreement approved pursuant to this subsection available for public inspection and copying within 10 days after the agreement is approved.</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> If an agreement between the two affected providers has not been finalized within 90 days from the date one provider notifies the other provider of the traffic exchange imbalance, then either provider may petition the PSC to fix charges set at the economic costs, and the terms and conditions for the continued termination of local exchange service calls. The PSC shall resolve each issue set forth in the petition and shall conclude the resolution of any unresolved issues not later than 9 months after the date on which one LEC received notification of the traffic imbalance.</dd>
            
                <dt>4</dt>
                <dd> The incumbent local exchange carrier shall make available any interconnection, service, or network element provided under an agreement approved pursuant to this subsection to any other requesting LEC upon the same terms and conditions as those provided in the agreement.</dd>
            
                <dt>h-1</dt>
                <dd> For a violation of any provision of this chapter or a violation of any rule or order issued under this chapter, after notice and a hearing, the Commission may:</dd>

                <dd> The Commission may temporarily suspend a certification, issue a temporary cease and desist order, or take any other appropriate temporary remedial action, pending a final determination after notice and hearing, if the Commission determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that customers or the reliability of the telecommunications service in the District of Columbia will be harmed by the actions of a telecommunications service provider.</dd>
            
                <dt>h-4</dt>
                <dd> A proceeding under this section may be initiated by the Commission, the Office of the People's Counsel, the Office of the Attorney General, or any aggrieved party.</dd>
