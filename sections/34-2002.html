                <dt>a</dt>
                <dd> The Public Service Commission may, upon petition by the incumbent local exchange carrier and pursuant to procedures developed by the PSC, reclassify any telecommunications service offered by the incumbent local exchange carrier.</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> Pursuant to the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104- 104), the Public Service Commission shall establish a procedure to facilitate entry into the District for providers of all forms of telecommunications service in order to foster the availability of competitive telecommunications options to consumers in the District, and to encourage the development of a technological infrastructure which will afford District residents increased access to the information highway.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> The procedure established by the Public Service Commission shall provide that local exchange carriers will be regulated according to each LEC's respective market power in the local exchange market, and in such manner as to prohibit abuse of monopoly power and facilitate adjustments in pricing as developing competition dictates a need for market flexibility.</dd>
            
                <dt>d</dt>
                <dd>(1) The Public Service Commission, in lieu of requiring a certificate of public convenience and necessity, shall grant any telecommunications service provider seeking to provide services within the District the authority to do so within 15 days of an applicant's filing with the Commission of a Statement of Business Operations, as described in subsection (e) of this section, and the payment of an application fee of $1000. The provider shall be exempt from any other certification requirements if the applicant demonstrates in its Statement of Business Operations that it or its affiliates have at least three years experience providing telecommunications services pursuant to authorizations by the FCC or a state regulatory body and that it or its affiliates derives over $50 million in gross annual revenues from telecommunications services.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> Any telecommunications service provider possessing a certificate of convenience and public necessity to operate within the District of Columbia as of September 9, 1996 is exempted from the requirements in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> For applicants other than those meeting the criteria set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection, subsequent to the applicant's filing of the Statement of Business Operations as described in subsection (e) of this section, and the payment of an application fee of $1000, the Commission may request additional information to determine whether the applicant has sufficient experience and financial stability to ensure the continued provision of local exchange services within the District. For such applicants, the Commission may waive the minimum experience and gross annual revenue requirements if it can determine that certification is in the public interest and that the applicant has sufficient experience and financial stability to ensure the continued provision of local exchange services within the District.</dd>
            
                <dt>A</dt>
                <dd> If the PSC requests additional information from the applicant, such request must be provided in writing within 15 days of the applicant's filing.</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> The applicant shall be afforded 15 days to provide the additional information requested by the PSC.</dd>
            
                <dt>C</dt>
                <dd> Upon receipt of the additional information from the applicant, the PSC must determine within 15 days whether the additional information satisfies the PSC in respect to the applicant's ability to ensure continued provision of telecommunication services to District consumers.</dd>
            
                <dt>D</dt>
                <dd> If the PSC determines that the additional information provides the necessary assurances, the PSC shall authorize the applicant to provide services within the District of Columbia; if the Commission determines that the applicant has not demonstrated sufficient experience and financing, the applicant shall be provided written notice of the deficiency.</dd>
            
                <dt>e</dt>
                <dd> The Statement of Business Operations required by this section shall contain, at a minimum, the following information of each telecommunications service provider:</dd>

The tariffs shall describe the service being offered, list all terms and conditions, and specify the rate or rates charged for the service.</dd>
            
                <dt>g</dt>

Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the Public Service Commission shall not regulate, fix, or prescribe the tolls, charges, rate structure, terms and conditions of service, rate base, rate of return, operating margin, earnings, cost of service, or the issuance of debt, equity, or other securities of any competitive telecommunications service provider, except that nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the PSC to establish service quality standards for such telecommunications service providers, to regulate terms and conditions of service (but not including rates, charges, and rate structure) to protect the public safety and welfare, provide for continued quality of telecommunications service, and safeguard the rights of consumers.</dd>
            
                <dt>h</dt>
                <dd> All local exchange carriers in the District are required to unbundle network elements to the extent that federal law requires, and to interconnect networks and exchange local exchange service calls under terms that are reasonable and efficient.</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> All LECs shall reciprocally terminate each other's local exchange service calls and shall financially compensate each other for this service if the PSC determines that a traffic imbalance exists. As between any two LECs, if at any time after implementation of local number portability pursuant to this chapter the traffic terminated by one provider, on a quarterly basis, is at least 5% greater than the traffic terminated by the other provider, the two affected LECs shall mutually negotiate an agreement regarding the charges, terms, and conditions for the termination of local exchange service calls that originate on their respective networks.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>

                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> If an agreement between the two affected providers has not been finalized within 90 days from the date one provider notifies the other provider of the traffic exchange imbalance, then either provider may petition the PSC to fix charges set at the economic costs, and the terms and conditions for the continued termination of local exchange service calls. The PSC shall resolve each issue set forth in the petition and shall conclude the resolution of any unresolved issues not later than 9 months after the date on which one LEC received notification of the traffic imbalance.</dd>
            
                <dt>4</dt>
                <dd> The incumbent local exchange carrier shall make available any interconnection, service, or network element provided under an agreement approved pursuant to this subsection to any other requesting LEC upon the same terms and conditions as those provided in the agreement.</dd>
            
                <dt>h-1</dt>
                <dd> For a violation of any provision of this chapter or a violation of any rule or order issued under this chapter, after notice and a hearing, the Commission may:</dd>
