        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-105, in subsec. (a), substituted "§ 47-355.06" for "subsection (a) of this section"; and, in subsec. (c), validated a previously made technical correction.

D.C. Law 16-293, rewrote subsecs. (a) and (c), which formerly read:

"(a) Within 30 days of [April 4, 2003], the Mayor and Chief Financial Officer shall establish a review board, which shall within 30 days of learning of a violation specified in § 47-355.06 by an agency convene a review board to investigate the causes of the violation. The review board shall assess the culpability of responsible employees, recommend an appropriate disciplinary action, and report to the Council the actions proposed to be taken based on the review board's findings."

"(c) The review board may recommend that no action be taken where it finds a justification for the violation. Justification may include overspending as a result of court orders, entitlements, or explicit authorization in an appropriations act."
