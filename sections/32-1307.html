                <dd> In addition to and apart from any other penalties or remedies provided for in this chapter, the Mayor shall assess and collect administrative penalties up to a maximum of $300 for the first violation and up to a maximum of $500 for each subsequent violation. The Mayor shall consider factors that include the history of previous violations by the employer, the administrative costs of the proceeding to collect, and the size of the employer's business, when determining the penalty to be imposed. In addition, the Mayor may assess more than one administrative penalty against an employer for the same adversely affected employee if the employer has violated more than one statutory provision of this chapter.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> No administrative penalty may be collected unless the Mayor provides any person alleged to have violated any of the provisions of this section notification of the violation, notification of the amount of the administrative penalty to be imposed, and an opportunity to request an informal hearing. If a formal hearing is requested, the Mayor shall issue a final order following the hearing, containing a finding that a violation has or has not occurred. If an informal hearing is not requested, the person to whom notification of violation was provided shall transmit to the Mayor the amount of the penalty within 15 days following notification.</dd>
