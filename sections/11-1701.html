1973 Ed., <a href='./11-1701.html'>§ 11-1701</a>.

Effect of Amendments

<a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%20108-335'>Pub. L. 108-335</a> repealed subsec. (b)(5) which had read as follows:

"(5) Approval of the bonds of fiduciary employees within the District of Columbia court system."

<a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%20109-356'>Pub. L. 109-356</a> made a technical correction to <a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%20108-335'>Pub. L. 108-335</a> that did not change the text of the section.

Effective Dates

<a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%20109-356'>Section 116(c) of Pub. L. 109-356</a> provides that the amendments made by this section shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2005 [<a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%20108-335'>Pub. L. 108-335</a>].

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, § 711 (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.11.html'>§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.14.html'>§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made, in brackets, in this section.
