Section 2703(a) of D.C. Law 13-38 provides: "Section 2702(c)(1) shall apply for tax years beginning after September 30, 1999."

D.C. Law 13-305, in subsecs. (c-3) and (c-4), substituted "September 30" for "June 30" wherever it appeared.

D.C. Law 14-147, repealed subsec. (c-3)(5); amended subsec. (d-1) by repealing par. (2), rewriting pars. (5) and (6), and adding par. (7); added subsec. (d-2); and repealed subsec. (e). Subsec. (c-3)(5), subsec. (d-1), pars. (2), (5) and (6) and subsec. (e) had read as follows:

"(5) Class 5 Property.--

"(A) Class 5 Property shall be comprised of all unimproved real property which is not Class 1 Property, Class 2 Property, Class 3 Property, or Class 4 Property.

"(B) Unimproved real property that abuts and has common ownership with real property subject to the apportionment provision of subsection (f) of this section and cannot be classified as Class 1 Property, Class 2 Property, Class 3 Property, or Class 4 Property shall also be classified as Class 5 Property."

"(2) To assist in the determination of real property classification for the tax year beginning July 1, 1991, and ending June 30, 1992, and each subsequent tax year, the Mayor shall devise a form and mail the form to the owner of real property classified as Class 2 Property, Class 3 Property, Class 4 Property, or Class 5 Property between January 1, 1991, and June 30, 1991, and biennially thereafter. The owner shall complete the form and return it to the Mayor within 30 days of the date the form was mailed to the owner. The Mayor may grant a reasonable extension of time, not to exceed 30 days, to file the form if the Mayor deems that good cause exists for an extension of time."

"(5) An owner of real property that becomes unoccupied shall notify the Mayor within 30 days of the date that the property becomes unoccupied. Failure to timely notify the Mayor that real property has become unoccupied shall subject the owner to a penalty equal to 25% of the real property tax owed for the tax year. The Mayor may waive the penalty for just cause."

"(6) If an owner of real property subject to the reporting requirements of this subsection fails to complete or return the required form or falsifies the required form, the real property shall be reclassified in accordance with the provisions of subsections (c-3) and (c-4) of this section and the owner shall be assessed a penalty equal to 25% of the real property tax owed for the tax year or $5,000, whichever is greater. The Mayor may waive the penalty for just cause."

"(e)(1) An application properly completed and timely filed in the manner and at the time as the Mayor shall prescribe, shall be required for purposes of classifying real property as Class 1 Property and imposing the applicable rate of taxation thereon. The Mayor may require an owner of real property to submit such additional information as in the Mayor's judgment will assist in determining the classification of real property under subsections (b), (c), (c-1), (c-2), (c-3), and (c-4) of this section, such information to be submitted at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Mayor.

"(2) Whenever any real property which obtained the Class 1 Property tax rate provided for in this section for the preceding tax year becomes ineligible for the Class 1 Property tax rate, the owner of such property shall notify the Mayor (in the manner and at the time as the Mayor shall prescribe) of the termination of eligibility. The Mayor may verify the eligibility of any real property, for which the Class 1 Property tax rate has been provided for any tax year, for the tax rate for any subsequent tax year.

"(3) If any owner of real property subject to the provisions of this section who is required to notify the Mayor under this subsection of a termination of eligibility for any tax year fails to notify the Mayor (in the manner and at the time as the Mayor shall prescribe) of the termination, the Class 1 Property tax rate shall be disallowed for each such tax year, and the property shall be reclassified in accordance with this section and shall be taxed at the appropriate rate of taxation for that class. There shall be added to the tax a penalty of 10% of the tax owed for each tax year in which the property was reclassified."

D.C. Law 14-307, in subsec. (c-4), substituted "For the real property tax year beginning October 1, 2001, and ending September 30, 2002" for "Except as provided by subsection (c-5) of this section, for the property tax year beginning October 1, 2001, and ending September 1, 2002, and for each subsequent tax year"; repealed subsec. (c-5); added subsec. (c-6); in subsec. (d), substituted "purposes" for "purposes of subsections (b), (c), (c-1), (c-2), (c-3), and (c-4)", and added par. (5); in subsec. (d-1), substituted "purposes of this section" for "purposes of (c-3) and (c-4) of this section" in the lead-in text, repealed par. (1), rewrote par. (3), added par. (3A), repealed par. (4), and deleted the last sentence in par. (5)(A); and, in subsec. (f)(1), deleted "subsections (c), (c-1), (c-2), (c-3), and (c-4) of" both times it appears. Prior to amendment, subsec. (c-5), and pars. (1), (3), (4) and (5)(A) of subsec. (d-1) had read as follows:

"(c-5) Subsection (c-4) of this section shall not apply if the certification by the Chief Financial Officer required by <a href='./47-387.01.html'>§ 47-387.01</a> demonstrates that the accumulated general fund balance for the immediately preceding fiscal year is below 5% of the general fund operating budget for the current fiscal year, the nominal GDP growth is less than or equal to 3.5% or the real GDP growth is less than or equal to 1.7%. (d) For the purposes of subsections (b), (c), (c-1), (c-2), (c-3), and (c-4) of this section:

"(1) The term "condominium" means the ownership of a single dwelling unit in a horizontal property regime as that term is used in <a href='./42-2003.html'>§ 42-2003</a>.

"(2) The term "cooperative housing association" means an association, whether incorporated or unincorporated, organized for the purpose of owning and operating residential real property, the shareholders or members of which, by reason of their ownership of a stock or membership certificate, a proprietary lease or other evidence of membership, are entitled to occupy a single dwelling unit pursuant to the terms of a proprietary lease or occupancy agreement.

"(3) The term "dwelling unit" means any room or group of rooms forming a single unit which is used for living, sleeping, and the preparation and eating of meals.

"(4) The term "nontransient" means occupancy of a dwelling unit or units by any person for a period of more than 5 consecutive days during any 1 stay in such unit."

D.C. Law 15-148 rewrote subsec. (c-6) which had read as follows:

"(c-6)(1) For the real property tax year beginning October 1, 2002, and ending September 30, 2003, and for each subsequent tax year, the following classes of taxable real property are established:

"(A) Class 1 Property;

"(B) Class 2 Property; and

"(C) Class 3 Property.

"(2)(A) Class 1 Property shall be comprised of residential real property that:

"(i) Is improved;

"(ii) Is occupied; and

"(iii) Is used exclusively for nontransient residential dwelling purposes.

"(B) Unimproved real property which abuts Class 1 Property shall be classified as Class 1 Property if the unimproved real property and the Class 1 Property have common ownership.

"(C) Unimproved real property which is separated from Class 1 Property by a public alley less than 30 feet wide shall be classified as Class 1 Property if the following conditions are met:

"(i) The unimproved real property is less than 1,000 square feet in size;

"(ii) The zoning regulations adopted by the Zoning Commission for the District of Columbia do not allow the building of any structure on the unimproved real property as a matter of right; and

"(iii) The owner of the unimproved real property also owns the Class 1 Property separated by the alley from the unimproved real property.

"(3) Class 2 Property shall be comprised of commercial real property that is improved and occupied.

"(4) Class 3 Property shall be comprised of all real property which is not Class 1 Property or Class 2 Property."

D.C. Law 15-354 substituted "Attorney General for the District of Columbia" for "Corporation Counsel"; and validated a previously made technical correction in subsec. (d-1)(3A)(B)(iii).

D.C. Law 16-33, added subsec. (c-6)(2)(E).

D.C. Law 17-216, in subsec.

(c-7), (d-1) (4)(A), (B); repealed subsecs. (d)(5) and (d-1)(3), (5)(a-i); rewrote subsecs. (d-1)(3A)(A), (5); in subsec. (d-1)(6), substituted "Class 3 Property" for "real property"; and, in subsec. (d-2), substituted "a change in classification to Class 3 Property" for "an erroneous or improper classification". Prior to amendment or repeal, subsecs. (d)(5) and (d-1)(3), (3A)(A), (5), read as follows:

"(5)(A) The term 'occupied' shall not include improved real property that:

"(i) Is required to be registered under <a href='./42-3131.06.html'>§ 42-3131.06</a>; or

"(B) All other improved real property shall be deemed occupied."

"(3)(A) A rebuttable presumption that a real property is not occupied shall arise when a real property appears on the list compiled under <a href='./42-3131.11.html'>§ 42-3131.11</a>. The Chief Financial Officer may require the owner, any person with legal or equitable title, and any person in the household of the owner to submit information that the Chief Financial Officer considers relevant to determine whether the real property remains occupied and entitled to the Class 1 Property or Class 2 Property classification.

When so requested, the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs shall report its findings to the Office of Tax and Revenue within 30 days of the request.

"(3A)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the owner may petition or appeal any reclassification under this section in the same manner and to the same extent as a new owner under <a href='./47-825.01.html'>§ 47-825.01(f-1)(1)</a>, regardless of the tax year involved or whether a prior petition or appeal had been filed for the tax year; provided, that the date notice of the reclassification is sent to the owner shall be deemed the date of transfer for purposes of the petition or appeal. The notice of reclassification sent under this subsection shall be in the form prescribed by the Chief Financial Officer, and may consist of a single bill and incorporate other deduction reversals, and shall not be deemed a proposed notice of assessment. The notice of reclassification shall include a general indication of the reason for the change in the classification and a statement explaining the right to appeal the reclassification. The petition or appeal filed under authority of this subparagraph shall be deemed to have been filed under <a href='./47-825.01.html'>§ 47-825.01(f-1)(1)</a>. A notice of final determination issued in furtherance of this subparagraph shall not include the assessor's worksheets."

"(5)(A) Whenever the classification of real property shall change, the owner shall notify the Mayor within 30 days of the change. If the owner fails to notify timely, the real property shall be reclassified without limitation for each tax year. Penalty and interest shall be added from the day the correct amount of tax was due but not paid."

"(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, if the real property is transferred and continued to qualify for the classification 30 days or less before the date of execution of the deed of transfer, the grantor shall not be required to notify the Mayor of the change in classification.

"(C) If the tax is paid within 30 days of the corresponding bill, timely notification of the change in classification shall preclude assessment of penalty and interest."
