In the case of the taxable year beginning in 1970, such regulations may not require payment before the last day on which a return for such taxable year is required to be filed under <a href='./47-1805.03.html'>§ 47-1805.03(a)</a> of an aggregate amount of estimated tax for such year in excess of one-half of such estimated tax; provided, however, that in the case of financial institutions, the provisions of this section shall be subject to <a href='./47-2507.html'>§ 47-2507(a)(3)</a> and to <a href='./47-2507.html'>§ 47-2507(b)(3)</a>.

"(b) Underpayment. --

"(B) Amount of underpayment. -- For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the amount of the underpayment shall be the excess of:

"(i) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the amount of the underpayment shall be the excess of:

"(I) The amount of the installment which would be required to be paid if the estimated tax were equal to 90% of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year or, if no return was filed, 90% of the tax for such year; over

"(II) The amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment.

"(ii) Every financial institution required to file a gross earnings tax return and a franchise tax return during the 3-year transition period described in <a href='./47-2507.html'>§ 47-2507(b)(2)</a> shall calculate the amount of underpayment for each such taxable year in accordance with <a href='./47-2507.html'>§ 47-2507(b)(3)(B)</a>.

"(C) Period of underpayment. -- (i)The period of the underpayment shall run from the date the installment was required to be paid to whichever of the following dates is the earlier:

"(II) With respect to any portion of the underpayment, the date on which such portion is paid.

"(ii) Every financial institution required to file a gross earnings tax return and a franchise tax return for the 3-year transition period described in <a href='./47-2507.html'>§ 47- 2507(b)(2)</a> shall calculate the amount of underpayment for each such taxable year in accordance with <a href='./47-2507.html'>§ 47-2507(b)(3)(B)</a>.

"(2) For purposes of subparagraphs (C) and (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, a payment of estimated tax on any installment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the extent such payment exceeds the amount of the installment determined under paragraph (1)(B)(i) of this subsection for such installment date.

"(c) Overpayment. -- Overpayment resulting from the payment of estimated tax for a taxable year in excess of the amount determined to be due upon the filing of a franchise tax return for such taxable year may be credited against the amount of estimated tax determined to be due on any declaration filed for the next succeeding taxable year or for any deficiency or nonpayment of tax for any previous taxable year.
