The Mayor shall then serve a second notice of infraction upon the respondent. If the respondent fails to answer the second notice of infraction within 15 calendar days of service, or within any other time period the Mayor may establish by rule or regulation, the respondent shall be liable for the penalty established pursuant to § 2-1801.04(a)(2)(B)."
