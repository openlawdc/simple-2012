Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 18-94 rewrote subsec. (a) and repealed subsec. (b), which had read as follows:

"(a) An application on behalf of a dependent child shall include in the TANF assistance unit the following individuals, if living in the same household as the dependent child and otherwise eligible:

"(1) The parent or parents of a dependent child, except that a parent who marries a person with whom the parent does not have any child in common shall not be included in the dependent child's assistance unit;

"(2) All blood-related, half-blooded-related, and adopted brothers and sisters of the dependent child who are themselves dependent children under age 18 or age 18 and expected to complete high school before reaching age 19; and

"(3) All dependent children living in the same household who are related by blood, half-blood, or legal adoption to any other member of the assistance unit by a relationship that would qualify an adult as a caretaker relative of that other member of the assistance unit as defined in <a href='./4-201.01.html'>§ 4-201.01(1C)</a>.

"(b) For the purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the Mayor shall determine the meaning of the term "full-time student", shall determine which vocational or technical training courses are equivalent to the level of secondary school, and shall determine which factors will be considered in deciding whether an individual may reasonably be expected to complete the program of study or training before reaching age 19."

D.C. Law 18-370, in subsec. (d), substituted "TANF" for federally-funded TANF".
