1981 Ed., § 45-1612.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-179, designated the existing text of subsec. (d) as subsec. (d)(1); in subsec. (d)(1), substituted "a member of the household's continued right to remain a tenant as guaranteed by this chapter is exercised" for "he or she is a head of household whose continued right to remain a tenant is required by this chapter"; and added subsec. (d)(2).

D.C. Law 17-247 rewrote subsec. (d), which had read as follows:

"(d) Qualified voter. -- (1) A head of household residing in each rental unit of the housing accommodation is qualified to vote unless no member of the household has resided in the accommodation for at least 90 days before the election, or unless a member of the household is or has been an employee of the owner within 120 days prior to the date of application for eligibility, or unless a member of the household's continued right to remain a tenant as guaranteed by this chapter is exercised. The Mayor shall determine the eligibility of voters prior to the election and shall devise such forms and procedures as may be necessary to verify eligibility under this subsection. (2) An elderly or disabled tenant who delivers a waiver under § 42- 3402.08(a)(2)(D) to the Mayor shall be qualified to vote in an election under this section."

D.C. Law 17-353 validated a previously made technical correction in subsec. (d).
