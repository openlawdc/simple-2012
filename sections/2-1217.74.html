        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-129 rewrote subsecs. (b)(1) and (5); and, in subsec. (c), deleted "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Rules of Operation shall provide that a Retail Development Project that, either directly or as part of a larger development project, has already received proceeds of Bonds through another TIF program shall not be designated a TIF Area under this subchapter." Prior to amendment, subsecs. (b)(1) and (5) read as follows:

"(1) A rating system designed to rank Retail Development Projects based on the following objective criteria:

"(A) The likelihood of Bond repayment based on projected Tax Increment Revenues or any other security authorized by this subchapter from or relating to the Retail Development Project;

"(B) The uniqueness of the retailer;

"(C) The likelihood that the retailer will attract other retailers to locate nearby;

"(D) The position of the retailer in its market and whether the retailer is the first in its market to locate in the Downtown Retail Priority Area;

"(E) The extent to which the retailer promotes the Downtown Retail Priority Area in its advertising;

"(F) The vertical integration of the retailer;

"(G) The intention of the retailer to locate on more than one level of the building in which it is located;

"(H) Whether the retailer builds an expressive storefront;

"(I) Whether the retailer is owned by a District resident or is based in the District;

"(J) The amount of space occupied by the retailer; and

"(K) Whether the retailer is one of multiple retailers that co-locate in the Downtown Retail Priority Area;"

"(5) A requirement that the owner of any building in which a TIF Area is located enter into a development agreement, satisfactory to the Mayor, that sets forth:

"(A) The goals and objectives for achieving the revitalization of retail development in the Downtown Retail Priority Area;

"(B) Requirements for the leasing of retail space in the building in a manner that will advance the goals and objectives;

"(C) The terms and conditions pursuant to which Bond proceeds will be advanced to pay Retail Development Costs incurred in connection with the TIF Area;

"(D) The owner's agreement to use good faith efforts to use LSDBEs to perform any construction work the cost of which is paid for or reimbursed by Bond proceeds;

"(E) The owner's agreement to require the retailer of the Retail Development Project to execute a first source agreement with the Department of Employment Services that establishes a goal of hiring District residents for at least 51% of the new jobs created by the Retail Development Project;

"(F) Such matters as may be required in connection with the issuance of the Bonds; and

"(G) Such other matters as the Mayor determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with such TIF Area;"

D.C. Law 17-262, in subsec. (b)(6), substituted "that the proceeds of the Bonds issued with respect to any TIF Area" for "that Bonds shall not be issued with respect to any TIF Area and the proceeds of the Bonds".

D.C. Law 17-353 , in subsec. (b)(1)(K), substituted "retailers or unique entertainment attractions that co-locate" for "retailers that co-locate".
