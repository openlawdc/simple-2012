        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 19-21 rewrote subsec. (d), which had read as follows:

"(d)(1) There is established as a nonlapsing fund the District of Columbia Supply Schedule, Purchase Card, and Training Fund ('Fund'), which shall be used to pay the costs associated with operating and maintaining the DCSS, the Purchase Card Program, cooperative purchasing agreements; the procurement training institute, or any other revenue, rebates, or fees generated by programs administered by OCP. All fees and amounts collected pursuant to subsections (a) through (c) of this section shall be deposited in the Fund.

"(2) All funds deposited in the Fund, and any interest earned on those funds, shall not revert to the unrestricted fund balance of the General Fund of the District of Columbia at the end of a fiscal year, or at any other time, but shall be continually available for the uses and purposed set forth in paragraph (1) of this section without regard to fiscal year limitation, subject to authorization by Congress."

D.C. Law 19-171, in the section name line, validated a previously made technical correction.
