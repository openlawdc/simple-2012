        <dl>

                <dd> Determine the scope of practice, the requirements which an applicant must meet for initial licensure, certification or registration and for renewal of the same, including any continuing education requirements, and shall determine the appropriate level of regulation for every occupation or professional under the authority of the board;</dd>
            
                <dt>A</dt>
                <dd> Where such standards already exist in any law or regulation of the District, those standards shall remain in effect until altered or amended; and</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> Each board shall be responsible for continually monitoring the standards for the professions and occupations under its authority and for recommending to the Mayor changes in existing standards when such changes are necessary or desirable;</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> Determine whether the standards for licensure by another jurisdiction, or certification by a national certifying organization, are substantially equivalent to the requirements of this subchapter and authorize the issuance of a license by reciprocity or endorsement to an applicant:</dd>

                <dt>6</dt>

                <dt>8</dt>
                <dd> Convene in committees smaller than the full board for the purpose of carrying out specific functions of the board, such as investigating complaints or determining appropriate discipline in accordance with the procedures set forth in §§ 47-2853.17 through 47-2853.19, provided that such smaller committees consist of not fewer than 3 board members, and the actions of such smaller committees are ratified by the full board;</dd>

                <dd> Notify the Mayor of actions taken regarding a licensee, certificate holder, or applicant; and</dd>
            
                <dt>10</dt>
