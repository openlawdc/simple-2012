The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on May 15, 2007, and June 5, 2007, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on June 28, 2007, it was assigned Act No. 17-63 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C.

The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia.
