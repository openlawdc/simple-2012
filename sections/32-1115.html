Upon a showing by an employer of a good-faith effort to comply with the abatement requirements of a citation and that abatement has not been completed because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the employer, the Mayor, after an opportunity for a hearing has been provided in accordance with this subsection, shall issue a decision and an order affirming or modifying the abatement requirement in the citation. The rules of procedure prescribed by the Mayor shall provide affected employees or representatives of affected employees an opportunity to participate as parties to hearings conducted under this subsection.</dd>

The Commission may review the record for error and each party shall be afforded an opportunity to present argument, either orally or in writing as the Commission may prescribe. The Commission shall provide a copy of its decision to each party or the party's representative of record. The Commission may sustain, reverse, modify, or vacate the decision or order of the Mayor or remand the case to the Mayor for further proceedings.</dd>
