Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-178 rewrote this section which formerly provided:

"(a) Methods of determining levels of payment or reimbursement for services, or for the type of facility charge eligible for payment or reimbursement pursuant to this chapter, shall be consistent with those for physical illnesses in general and shall take into consideration usual, customary, and reasonable charges for those services. Except as otherwise provided in <a href='./35-2304.html'>§ 35-2304(b)</a> [1981 Ed.], deductible or copayment plans, and limits on total amounts payable to an individual in a calendar year or lifetime payment limits may be applied; Provided, however, that the inpatient and outpatient benefits set forth in <a href='./35-2304.html'>§ 35-2304</a> [1981 Ed.] shall be provided with a lifetime payment limit of not less than $80,000 or one third of the lifetime maximum for physical illness, whichever is greater.

"(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring health maintenance organizations to provide any greater level of covered benefits than the level required of insurers."

D.C. Law 16-232, repealed subsec. (e), which formerly read:

"(e) The mental parity provisions in this section shall not apply to benefits for services furnished after September 29, 2001, unless these provisions are re-enacted."

D.C. Law 16-242, in subsec. (b), substituted "health benefit plan or certificate" for "health insurance"; and, in subsec. (d), substituted "health insurers" for "insurers".
