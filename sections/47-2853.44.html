"(1) At least one member thereof is a certified public accountant of the District in good standing;

"(2) Each member thereof must be a certified public accountant of a state in good standing; and

"(3) At least one member or the resident manager in charge of an office of the firm in the District and each member thereof personally engaged within the District in the practice of public accounting as a member thereof must be a certified public accountant of the District in good standing.

"(b) A firm that is a corporation organized for the practice of public accounting shall also comply with the provisions of Chapter 4 of Title 29, governing the issuance, ownership, and transferability of shares and be in compliance with such regulations as may be issued for such corporations.

"(c) A firm which is registered pursuant to this section and which holds a permit issued by the Board may use the words 'certified public accountants' or the abbreviation 'CPA' in connection with its firm name. Notification shall be given the Board within one month after the admission or withdrawal of a member or shareholder in practice in the District from any firm so registered."

D.C. Law 18-378, in par. (2), substituted "Chapter 5" for "Chapter 4".

D.C. Law 19-43 redesignated subsecs. (a) to (f) as subsecs. (b) to (g); added subsec. (a); rewrote redesignated subsec. (b); in subsec. (d), substituted "issued by the Board, or that is exempt from holding a registration and permit under subsection (a)(2) and (3) of this section" for ""issued by the Board", and substituted "pursuant to this section, except as provided in subsection (a)(2) and (3) of this section", for "pursuant to this section". Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) [now redesignated as subsec. (b)] read as follows:

"(a) A firm engaged in the District in the practice of public accounting may register with the Board as a firm of certified public accountants if it meets the following requirements:

"(B) Partners, officers, shareholders, members, or managers whose principal place of business is in the District or who perform professional services in the District shall be licensed under this part.

"(7) A licensed individual who signs, or authorizes another person to sign, the accountants' report on the financial statements on behalf of the firm shall meet the competency requirements set forth in the professional standards."

D.C. Law 19-171, in subsec. (b)(5)(A), inserted commas following "in the District" and "<a href='./47-2853.49.html'>§ 47-2853.49</a>" and deleted "shall be" preceding "an individual".
