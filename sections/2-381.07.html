The prohibition in the preceding sentence on the availability of material, answers, or transcripts shall not apply if consent is given by the person who produced such material, answers, or transcripts. Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to prevent disclosure to the District of Columbia Council, including any committee of the Council, to the United States Attorney's Office, or to any other agency of the United States for use by such agency in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities. Disclosure of information to any agency other than the Council or the United States Attorney's Office shall be allowed only upon application, made by the Corporation Counsel to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, showing substantial need for the use of the information by such agency in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities and after giving the individuals who provided the information an opportunity to be heard on the release of the information.</dd>
