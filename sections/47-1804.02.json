In the case of death of a taxpayer on the cash basis, no amount will be accrued on his final return; and on the accrual basis, amounts (except amounts includible in computing a partner's net income) accrued only by reason of the death of the taxpayer shall not be included in computing net income for the period in which falls the date of the taxpayer's death, but such amounts shall be included in the income of the person receiving such amounts by inheritance or survivorship from the decedent.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., § 47-1804.2.\n\n1973 Ed., § 47-1561a.\n\nDC CODE § 47-1804.02\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(July 16, 1947, 61 Stat. 339, ch. 258, art.
