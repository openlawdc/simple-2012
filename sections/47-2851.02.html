"(1) A person who does not maintain a business address in the District of Columbia and who engages in business only in affiliation with a licensed business providing the same or similar services; or

"(2) A person whose annual gross receipts are $2,000 or less in any calendar year; provided, that the person is not required to obtain a license under one of the Class A License endorsement categories set forth in § 47-2851.03.

"(b) Each license shall specify the particular business or businesses the licensee is authorized to operate, as defined by District law or regulation, and no licensee shall be permitted to engage in activities outside the scope of the license.

"(c) A license shall be required for each business location.

"(d) No person issued a license under this subchapter shall willfully allow any other person required to obtain a separate license to operate under his or her license.
