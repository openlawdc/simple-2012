The Mayor shall approve the settlement, where both parties are represented by legal counsel who are eligible to receive attorney fees pursuant to <a href='./32-1530.html'>ยง 32-1530</a>. These settlements shall be the complete and final dispositions of a case and shall be a final binding compensation order.</dd>
