                <dt>ii</dt>
                <dd> The compensation shall be 66 2/3% of the greater of:</dd>

                <dt>iii</dt>
                <dd> If the employee voluntarily limits his or her income or fails to accept employment commensurate with the employee's abilities, the employee's wages after the employee becomes disabled shall be deemed to be the amount the employee would earn if the employee did not voluntarily limit his or her income or did accept employment commensurate with the employee's abilities. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, in the case of injury occurring on or after April 16, 1999, the periods of compensation set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (S) of this paragraph shall each be reduced by a proportion of 25% of the stated period of weeks, rounded upward to the nearest whole week.</dd>

                <dt>A</dt>
                <dd> If there be a surviving spouse or domestic partner and no child of the deceased to such spouse or domestic partner;</dd>

                <dt>E</dt>
                <dd> If there be no surviving spouse or domestic partner and no surviving children, such unpaid amount of the award shall be paid to the survivors specified in <a href='./32-1509.html'>§ 32-1509</a> (other than a spouse, domestic partner, or child); and the amount to be paid each such survivor shall be determined by multiplying such unpaid amount of the award by the appropriate percentage specified in <a href='./32-1509.html'>§ 32-1509(4)</a>, but if the aggregate amount to which all such survivors are entitled, as so determined, is less than such unpaid amount of the award, the excess amount shall be divided among such survivors pro rata according to the amount otherwise payable to each.</dd>
            
                <dt>5</dt>
                <dd> In case of temporary partial disability, the compensation shall be 66 2/3% of the injured employee's wage loss to be paid during the continuance of such disability, but shall not be paid for a period exceeding 5 years. Wage loss shall be the difference between the employee's average weekly wage before the employee had the disability and the employee's actual wages after the employee had the disability. If the employee voluntarily limits his income or fails to accept employment commensurate with his abilities, then his wages after the employee had the disability shall be deemed to be the amount he would earn if he did not voluntarily limit his income or did accept employment commensurate with his abilities.</dd>
            
                <dt>6</dt>
                <dd>(A) If an employee receives an injury, which combined with a previous occupational or nonoccupational disability or physical impairment causes substantially greater disability or death, the liability of the employer shall be as if the subsequent injury alone caused the subsequent amount of disability and shall be the payment of:</dd>
            
                <dt>i</dt>
                <dd> All medical expenses;</dd>
            
                <dt>ii</dt>
                <dd> All monetary benefits for temporary total or partial injuries; and</dd>
            
                <dt>iii</dt>
                <dd> Monetary benefits for permanent total or partial injuries up to 104 weeks.</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> The special fund shall reimburse the employer solely for the monetary benefits paid for permanent total or partial injuries after 104 weeks.</dd>
            
                <dt>C</dt>
                <dd> The requirements of this paragraph shall apply to injuries occurring prior to April 16, 1999.</dd>
            
                <dt>7</dt>
                <dd> In each case, payment of benefits shall be 66 2/3% of the employee's average weekly wage.</dd>
            
                <dt>8</dt>
                <dd> The Mayor may approve lump-sum settlements agreed to in writing by the interested parties, discharging the liability of the employer for compensation, notwithstanding §<a href='./32-1516.html'>§ 32-1516</a> and 32-1517, in any case where the Mayor determines that it is in the best interest of an injured employee entitled to compensation or individuals entitled to benefits pursuant to <a href='./32-1509.html'>§ 32-1509</a>. The Mayor shall approve the settlement, where both parties are represented by legal counsel who are eligible to receive attorney fees pursuant to <a href='./32-1530.html'>§ 32-1530</a>. These settlements shall be the complete and final dispositions of a case and shall be a final binding compensation order.</dd>
            
                <dt>9</dt>
                <dd> Repealed.</dd>
            
                <dt>10</dt>
                <dd> An award for disability may be made after the death of an injured employee from causes other than work-related injury. If the award made is for permanent partial disability, pursuant to paragraph (3)(A) through (U) of this section, the award shall be payable in full pursuant to paragraph (4) of this section. If the award made is for any other category of disability, the amount of the award shall be computed from the date of the injury to the date of death, and shall be payable in full in the same manner as an award payable pursuant to paragraph (4) of this section.</dd>
