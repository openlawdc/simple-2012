1981 Ed., § 35-4714.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-166, in par. (3) of subsec. (j), substituted "Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking" for "Department of Insurance and Securities Regulation" both times it appears.

D.C. Law 16-192 repealed subsec. (f) and rewrote subsecs. (j) and (k) which had read as follows:

"(f) A corporation must prominently advertise the availability of its open enrollment subscriber contracts quarterly in a newspaper or newspapers of general circulation throughout the District of Columbia. The content and format of such advertising shall be filed with the Mayor at least 60 days prior to use."

"(j) As long as a corporation maintains an open enrollment program as required by this section, the rate of tax applied to the corporation's net subscriber premium receipts from District of Columbia risks ('premium tax rate') shall be 1%, rather than the percentage otherwise applicable pursuant to § <a href='./47-2608.html'>§ 47-2608</a>.

"(1) A corporation may elect to pay the 1% premium tax rate or contribute the amount otherwise so paid to a separately established Rate Stabilization Fund. The Rate Stabilization Fund shall be used solely to subsidize open enrollment contracts to assure competitive rates. The corporation shall provide documentation to the Mayor of the existence of a Rate Stabilization Fund and identify the amount of the subsidy from the Fund for open enrollment rates in the rate filings required by <a href='./31-3508.html'>§ 31-3508</a>.

"(2) A corporation's annual statement pursuant to <a href='./31-1901.html'>§ 31-1901</a>, shall include documentation of its efforts to substantiate the need for a 1% premium tax rate as an incentive to maintain an open enrollment program. Such documentation shall include the number of subscribers participating in its open enrollment program, the premiums it charges for comprehensive individual subscriber contracts, a description of its efforts to provide the public services required by subsection (i) of this section, and such other documentation as the Mayor may require. If the Mayor finds that the documentation provided by a corporation does not substantiate the 1% premium tax rate, the Mayor shall provide written notice to the corporation of this finding no later than April 1 of the same year, and the corporation shall pay the premium tax rate established in <a href='./47-2608.html'>§ 47-2608</a>, except as provided in paragraph 3 of this subsection.

"(3) Within 30 days after the date of the written notice required by paragraph (2) of this subsection, a corporation may make a written request for a hearing on the Mayor's findings that the corporation failed to substantiate the imposition of a 1% premium tax rate by delivering the request to the Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking. The hearing shall commence in not fewer than 10 days nor more than 30 days from the date on which the request for hearing is received by the Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking. The hearing and its disposition shall be governed by the rules for contested cases set forth in chapter 1 of title 26 (Insurance) of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (26 DCMR chapter 1). Any premium tax payments that become due during the time that the Mayor's finding is being contested shall be paid at the 1% premium tax rate. If the corporation loses or withdraws the case, it shall reimburse the District the difference between the payments made at the 1% premium tax rate and the payment that it would have made at the rate established in <a href='./47-2608.html'>§ 47-2608</a>.

"(k) Upon the date of discontinuance of its open enrollment program as defined in this section, the 1% premium tax rate shall no longer apply to the corporation and the corporation's net subscriber premium receipts from District of Columbia risks shall be taxed at the rate established in <a href='./47-2608.html'>§ 47-2608</a>."

D.C. Law 17-369, in subsec. (j)(2), substituted "shall order annually an independent" for "may order an independent"; rewrote subsec. (k); and added subsecs. (m), (n), and (o). Prior to amendment, subsec. (k) read as follows:

"(k)(1) A corporation shall maintain its open enrollment program for subscribers who are enrolled in the program as of March 2, 2007, and shall, subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, continue to offer the program to each such subscriber for as long as the subscriber renews his or her coverage under the program.

"(2) The corporation shall not be required to offer or maintain an open enrollment program for persons who are not subscribers enrolled in the program as of March 2, 2007. The corporation shall not use any money in the RS Fund to subsidize the open enrollment rate of any person who was not a subscriber to the open enrollment program as of March 2, 2007.

"(3) The obligation of the corporation to maintain an open enrollment program under paragraph (1) of this subsection may terminate on December 31, 2010. If the corporation thereafter elects to terminate the open enrollment program, the corporation shall submit a plan for termination to the Commissioner for approval, and immediately upon receipt of the Commissioner's written approval, the corporation shall promptly pay to the District of Columbia Treasurer, as a payment otherwise due under <a href='./31-3514.01.html'>§ 31-3514.01</a>, all amounts remaining in the RS Fund, and such amounts shall be credited to the Healthy DC Fund. Upon termination of the open enrollment program, the Mayor shall ensure that subscribers who are enrolled in the program at the time of its termination are provided with an opportunity to enroll in a comparable individual line of health coverage at no additional cost to the subscriber."

D.C. Law 18-104 added subsecs. (p), (q) and (r).

D.C. Law 18-223, in subsec. (j)(2), substituted "Healthy DC and Health Care Expansion Fund" for "Healthy DC Fund".

Section 201(b) of D.C. Law 18-271, in subsec. (d), substituted "District of Columbia who is ineligible for the DC High Risk Pool Program," for "District of Columbia,".
