(a)(3) which had read as follows:\n\n\"(a)(3) For any real property that discharges waste water into a District-owned sanitary sewer that derives from groundwater or cooling water, the real property owner shall pay a sanitary sewer service charge separate from any sanitary sewer service charge levied in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection. The separate and additional sanitary sewer service charge shall apply to and be measured by the quantity of water that is derived from the groundwater or cooling water and is discharged into the District sanitary or combined sewer system. Unless the Mayor determines that it is not practicable, the owner of the real property shall install and maintain, at a location approved by the Mayor and without cost to the District, any sanitary meter or device necessary to measure the quantity of groundwater or cooling water discharged into the District's sanitary sewage works. The amount of the sanitary sewer service charge shall be set at the same rate as the rate paid by the owner of a metered building that receives water from the District water supply system.\"\n\nD.C. Law 17-370, in subsec. (a), rewrote the lead-in language and par. (1) and repealed par.(2); and added subsec. (c). Prior to amendment, the lead-in language and pars. (1) and (2) of subsec. (a) read as follows:\n\n\"(a) The sanitary sewer service charges established under the authority of this subchapter shall be based on the water consumption of, and water service to, the properties served, and be determined by one of the following methods:\n\n\"(1) Where water is supplied from the District water supply system at meter rates, the Council of the District of Columbia shall establish the sanitary sewer service charge as a percentage of the water charge applicable in the District.\n\n\"(2) Where water is supplied from the District water supply system, which water is not measured by meter, but is supplied at special business and miscellaneous rates, the Council shall establish the sanitary sewer service charge at a percentage of such special business and miscellaneous rates.\"\n\nEmergency Act Amendments\n\nFor temporary (90 day) amendment of section, see § 8 of Technical Amendments Emergency Act of 2001 (D.C. Act 14-108, August 3, 2001, 48 DCR 7622).\n\nFor temporary (90 day) amendment of section, see § 3802 of Fiscal Year 2003 Budget Support Emergency Act of 2002 (D.C. Act 14-453, July 23, 2002, 49 DCR 8026).\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nFor legislative history of D.C. Law 8-136, see Historical and Statutory Notes following § 34-2301.\n\nLaw 14-190, the \"Fiscal Year 2003 Budget Support Act of 2002\", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 14-609, which was referred to the Committee of the Whole. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on May 7, 2002, and June 4, 2002, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on July 3, 2002, it was assigned Act No. 14-403 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 14-190 became effective on October 1, 2002.\n\nLaw 17-370, the \"Water and Sever Authority Equitable Ratemaking Amendment Act of 2008\", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 17-935 which was referred to the Committee on Public Works and the Environment. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on December 2, 2008, and December 16, 2008, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on January 23, 2009, it was assigned Act No. 17-705 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 17-370 became effective on March 25, 2009.\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402 (326) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nShort title of title XXXIX of Law 14-190: Section 3901 of D.C.
