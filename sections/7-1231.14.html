                <dd> A provider may conduct an initial interview of a minor who appears to be voluntarily seeking outpatient mental health services and mental health supports without parental or guardian consent or involvement in order to determine whether the criteria of subsection (b)(1) of this section are satisfied.</dd>

                <dd> When the minor's parent(s) or guardian is not reasonably available to make a decision regarding the administration of psychotropic medication and the treating physician determines that the minor has capacity to consent, consistent with § 7-1231.08, and that such medications are clinically appropriate;</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> When requiring consent of the minor's parent(s) or guardian would have a detrimental effect on the minor, and a determination is made by both the treating physician and a non-treating psychiatrist who is not an employee of the provider that the minor has capacity to consent, consistent with § 7- 1231.08, and that such medications are clinically indicated;</dd>
            
                <dt>C</dt>
