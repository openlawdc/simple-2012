                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> Maximum rent and purchase prices established through a schedule applicable to low-income households shall be set so that a household earning 50% of the Metropolitan Statistical Area median will expend no more than approximately 30% of its annual income on the applicable housing costs identified in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.</dd>
