Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-15 rewrote par. (e)(2), which previously read:

"The Mayor may, in accordance with standards to be established by regulation, issue, renew, suspend, revoke, or deny a solid waste facility permit, and determine, vary, or modify its terms and conditions. No solid waste facility permit shall be issued or renewed until the Mayor has determined that the solid waste facility is operating, or will operate, in full compliance with environmental, health, safety, and zoning laws, rules, and regulations and that the solid waste facility will not endanger human health, the public welfare, or the environment. A contrary determination shall allow the Mayor to order closure of an existing facility."
