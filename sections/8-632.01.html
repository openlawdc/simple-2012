        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 18-369 substituted "DDOE" for EHA"; rewrote subsec. (b); in the lead-in text of subsec. (c), substituted "who, with regard to a property from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance that causes or contributes to the incurrence of a response cost" for "who"; and, in subsec. (c)(1) and (2), substituted "operator" for "operator of a contaminated property". Prior to amendment, subsec. (b) read as follows:

"(b) Any person who causes or contributes to the contamination of a property shall be strictly, jointly and severally, liable for the costs, including the interests on the costs of abatement actions, remedial cleanup, health or any other risk assessment or any other responsive actions taken by the District."
