Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-35 repealed subsec. (e) which had read as follows:

"(e) Whenever the Abandoned and Junk Vehicle Division of the Department of Public Works shall have in its custody any motor vehicle upon which there is a lien or liens of record in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia, it shall, prior to the sale thereof pursuant to this section, notify by registered or certified mail each lienor and lienee in any such case of such custody and impending sale, and if such lienor or lienee fail to remove such property from the custody of the Abandoned and Junk Vehicle Division of the Department of Public Works within 45 days from the date of the mailing of such notification, such lien or liens shall be considered to have been abandoned, and shall be thenceforth null and void. Upon being notified in writing of such fact by the Abandoned and Junk Vehicle Division of the Department of Public Works, the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia is authorized to indicate on his records that such lien or liens are thenceforth null and void and the Abandoned and Junk Vehicle Division of the Department of Public Works is authorized to sell any such motor vehicle at public auction free and clear of such lien and liens; except that the proceeds of such sale shall be available:

"(1) For the payment of all expenses incident to such sale and custody;

"(2) For the payment of such liens so declared null and void;

"(3) For payment to the owner in accordance with subsection (a) of this section; and

"(4) The remainder, if any, shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the District of Columbia."
