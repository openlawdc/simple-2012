{"text":"The Mayor of the District of Columbia is hereby authorized to enter into and execute on behalf of the District of Columbia an agreement with any state or states legally joining therein in the form substantially as set forth in this section.\n\nTHE INTERSTATE COMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH\n\nARTICLE I -- PURPOSE AND FINDINGS\n\nThe party states find that the proper and expeditious treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient can be facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their families, and society as a whole. Further, the party states find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare.\n\nARTICLE II -- DEFINITIONS\n\nAs used in this compact:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE III -- ELIGIBILITY AND PLACEMENT OF PATIENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE IV -- AFTER-CARE OR SUPERVISION IN THE RECEIVING STATE\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE V -- ESCAPE OF DANGEROUS OR POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PATIENTS\n\nWhenever a dangerous or potentially dangerous patient escapes from an institution in any party state, that state shall promptly notify all appropriate authorities within and without the jurisdiction of the escape in a manner reasonably calculated to facilitate the speedy apprehension of the escapee. Immediately upon the apprehension and identification of any such dangerous or potentially dangerous patient, he shall be detained in the state where found pending disposition in accordance with law.\n\nARTICLE VI -- TRANSPORTING PATIENTS THROUGH PARTY STATES\n\nThe duly accredited officers of any state party to this compact, upon the establishment of their authority and the identity of the patient, shall be permitted to transport any patient being moved pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact, without interference.\n\nARTICLE VII -- PAYMENT OF COSTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE VIII -- GUARDIANS\n\n\n\nARTICLE IX--INAPPLICABILITY OF COMPACT TO PERSONS SUBJECT TO PENAL SENTENCE;\nPOLICY AGAINST PLACEMENT OF PATIENTS IN PRISONS OR JAILS\n\n\n\nARTICLE X -- COMPACT ADMINISTRATORS\n\n\n\nARTICLE XI -- SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENTS\n\nThe duly constituted administrative authorities of any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements for the provision of any service or facility or for the maintenance of any institution on a joint or cooperative basis whenever the states concerned shall find that such agreements will improve services, facilities, or institutional care and treatment in the fields of mental illness or mental deficiency. No such supplementary agreement shall be construed so as to relieve any party state of any obligation which it otherwise would have under other provisions of this compact.\n\nARTICLE XII -- EFFECTIVE DATE OF COMPACT\n\nThis compact shall enter into full force and effect as to any state when enacted by it into law and such state shall thereafter be a party thereto with any and all states legally joining therein.\n\nARTICLE XIII -- WITHDRAWAL FROM COMPACT\n\n\n\nARTICLE XIV -- CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., § 6-1801.\n\n1973 Ed., § 6-1601.\n\nReferences in Text\n\nThe reference to \"Article XII(b),\" in Article XIII(b), should probably be a reference to \"Article VII(b).\".\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nComplementary Legislation:\nAla.--Code 1975, §§ 22-55-1 to 22-55-4.\nAlaska--AS 47.30.880.\nArk.--A.C.A. §§ 20-50-101 to 20-50-106.\nColo.--West's C.R.S.A. §§ 24-60-1001 to 24-60-1006.\nConn.--C.G.S.A. §§ 17a-615 to 17a-618.\nDel.--16 Del.C. §§ 6101 to 6105.\nD.C.--D.C.
