        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-313 rewrote subsec. (a) which had read:

"(a) A person aggrieved by an act, determination, rule, regulation, order, or any other action of the Mayor, may appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in accordance with § 2-510."

D.C. Law 14-150 substituted "Commissioner" for "Mayor" throughout the section.
