Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-172 added par. (5), and rewrote par. (4), which previously read:

"(4) Establish and regulate the process through which any modification or damage to the public space, public rights of way, or public structure may be compensated. The regulations shall include provisions governing the appropriate bonding and insurance requirements which must be satisfied by any party who receives a permit issued pursuant to this subchapter, and shall provide for any permittee to provide comprehensive indemnification to the District for any costs or damages which it incurs as a result of actions taken by the permittee in connection with the exercise of any rights or privileges granted in any permit issued pursuant to this subchapter."

Section 503 of D.C. Law 13-172 provides:

"The amendments made by section 502 of this title to the public rights-of-way rental fees do not preclude the Mayor from further amending these same fees as authorized in section 604 of the Fiscal Year 1997 Budget Support Act of 1996 provided that the amended rates, when taken together with the other user fees, charges, and penalties collected pursuant to that section and D.C. Code <a href='./47-2718.html'>§ 47-2718</a> do not adversely impact the positive fiscal impact identified in section 506 of this title."

D.C. Law 15-39 repealed par. (5) which had read as follows:

"(5) The first $30 million dollars of annual revenue derived from the collection of the public rights-of-way user fees, charges, and penalties established pursuant to this section shall be dedicated to the Department of Public Works for expenditures related to street and alley repairs and maintenance that would otherwise be paid out of the General Fund. Any revenues in excess of $30 million annually from the collection of these public rights-of-way user fees, charges, and penalties shall be dedicated to the District of Columbia Highway Trust Fund".

D.C. Law 15-105, in par. (5), validated a previously made technical corrections.

D.C. Law 18-223 deleted "and" from the end of par. (3); substituted "; and" for a period at the end of par. (4); and added par. (5).
