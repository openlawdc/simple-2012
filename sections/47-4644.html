Legislative History of Laws

Law 18-292, the "Thirteenth Church of Christ Real Property Tax Relief and Exemption Act of 2010", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 18-776, which was referred to the Committee on Finance and Revenue. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on October 5, 2010, and November 9, 2010, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on November 19, 2010, it was assigned Act No. 18-613 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 18-292 became effective on March 8, 2011.

Miscellaneous Notes

Section 4 of D.C. Law 18-292 provides:

"Sec. 4. Applicability.

"This act shall apply upon the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan."

The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of February 15, 2012, that the fiscal effect of Law 18-292 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 18-292, are not in effect.
