                <dd>(1) The Board, on the basis of such reports from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, shall determine the extent to which such disability retirements which such Agency determined were caused or contributed to by such events and circumstances caused a reduction in the amount appropriated to the Fund as provided under this subsection.  The Board shall report the amount of such reduction so caused to the offices and officers set forth in subsection (b)(1) of this section.   Such reports shall be submitted on or before December 31st of the calendar year in which the Board receives such report of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</dd>
