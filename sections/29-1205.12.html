                <dd> If a statutory trust is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, approved August 22, 1940 (54 Stat. 789; 15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq.), or any successor statute and any regulations issued thereunder, a trustee shall be an independent trustee for all purposes under this chapter if the trustee shall is not an interested person of the trust.
