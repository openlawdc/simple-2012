Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-194 rewrote subsec. (a); and in subsec. (b), substituted "Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department" for "District of Columbia Fire Department". Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) had read as follows:

"(a) The Chief of the District of Columbia Fire Department may establish a firefighter cadet program for the purpose of instructing, training, and exposing interested persons, primarily young adults residing in the District of Columbia, to the operations of the District of Columbia Fire Department and the duties, tasks, and responsibilities of serving as a firefighter with the District of Columbia Fire Department."

Legislative History of Laws

The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on October 19, 1982, and November 16, 1982, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on December 8, 1982, it was assigned Act No. 4-254 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review.
