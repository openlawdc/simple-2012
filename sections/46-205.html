"(1) For an original support order or modification of a support order that is effective on or after January 1, 1994, notice that support payments shall be withheld from earnings or other income immediately, unless the Court finds there is good cause not to impose immediate withholding or the parties agree in writing to an alternative method of payment;

"(1A) In the case of a support order that is issued or modified on or after November 1, 1990, a finding of good cause not to require immediate withholding shall be based on at least:

"(B) If the modification of a support order is at issue, a written explanation that there is proof of timely payment of previously ordered support obligations;

"(2) Notice that if withholding commences, all payments shall be made through the Court registry and any other payments shall be considered a gift and shall not offset the duty of support ordered by the Court; and
