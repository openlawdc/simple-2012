Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-33, in subsec. (b), deleted "and each Level III physician office laboratory" following "clinical laboratory" in the first sentence; and rewrote subsec. (a), which had read as follows:

"(a) The Mayor shall conduct inspections of clinical laboratories and Level II and Level III physician office laboratories, methods, procedures, materials, staff, and equipment with an option to inspect Level I physician office labs as deemed appropriate. Nothing shall prohibit an authorized District government official from entering the premises of any laboratory regulated by this chapter during operating hours for the purpose of conducting an announced or unannounced inspection consistent with constitutional guidelines to check for compliance with any provision of this chapter or rules issued pursuant to this chapter. In conducting an inspection, the District government official shall make every effort not to disrupt the normal operations of the laboratory and its staff."

Emergency Act Amendments
