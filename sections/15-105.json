The decree constitutes notice to all persons of the transfer of title when a copy thereof is registered among the land-records of the District. In particular cases, the court may order its officer or agent to make a conveyance, if that mode is deemed preferable.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., ยง 15-105.\n\n1973 Ed., ยง 15-105.\n\nDC CODE ยง 15-105\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Dec. 23, 1963, 77 Stat. 523, Pub.
