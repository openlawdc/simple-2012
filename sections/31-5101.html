1981 Ed., § 35-1001.

1973 Ed., § 35-1601.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-263 added subsec. (c).

D.C. Law 14-132 repealed subsec. (c) which had read:

"(c) Sections §§ 31-5110.01, 31-5111, and 31-5112 shall apply to an insurance plan or program for which an application of approval has been submitted to the Commissioner under § 42-836.01(2)(B)."

D.C. Law 15-105 purported to amend subsec. (c) which was repealed by D.C. Law 14-132, therefore, the amendment was ineffective.
