Legislative History of Laws

Law 10-174, the "Policemen and Firemen's Retirement Relief Board Amendment Act of 1994," was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 10-578, which was referred to the Committee on Government Operations. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on June 21, 1994, and July 5, 1994, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on July 25, 1994, it was assigned Act No. 10-294 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 10-174 became effective on September 22, 1994.

References in Text

Office of Personnel was substituted for Personnel Office in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section pursuant to Mayor's Order No. 79-84, dated May 10, 1979.

Department of Human Services was substituted for Department of Human Resources in subsection (a)(1)(A) and (a)(2) pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1979, dated February 21, 1980.

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.

Delegation of Authority
