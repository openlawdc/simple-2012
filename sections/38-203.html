Miscellaneous Notes

Section 601 of D.C. Law 19-141, as amended by section 7004 of D.C. Law 19-168, reads as follows: "Sections 302(b)(1), 304, and 502(a) shall apply upon the inclusion of their fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan.".

The fiscal effect of sections 302(b)(1), 304, and 502 of D.C. Law 19-141 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 19-141, are not in effect.
