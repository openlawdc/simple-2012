                <dd> The Recorder of Deeds shall accept for filing any notice of federal tax lien or any other document affecting such a lien if such notice or document is in the form prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate and could be filed with the Clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The fee for each such filing with the Recorder of Deeds shall be the same as the fee charged by the Recorder of Deeds for filing a similar document for a private person.

Any document releasing or affecting any notice of federal tax lien which has been filed with the Clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia prior to the effective date of this subsection shall be filed with such Clerk.</dd>
