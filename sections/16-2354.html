Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-136 rewrote this section, which previously read:

"(a) A motion for the termination of the parent and child relationship may be filed by the District of Columbia government or by the child through his or her legal representative.

"(b) A motion for the termination of the parent and child relationship may be filed only when the child who is the subject of the motion has been adjudicated neglected at least six (6) months prior to the filing of the motion and the child is in the court-ordered custody of a department, agency, institution or person other than the parent; except that the motion for termination may be filed immediately--

"(1) upon an adjudication that the child was abandoned; or

"(2) when, despite reasonable efforts, the parent could not be located for the factfinding hearing and during the three (3) months prior to the hearing.

"(c) A motion for the termination of the parent and child relationship shall include but not be limited to:

"(1) the name, sex, date and place of birth, and current placement of the child;

"(2) the name and title of the petitioner;

"(3) the name and address of the child's parent;

"(4) a plain and concise statement of the facts and opinions on which the termination of the parent and child relationship is sought;

"(5) a specification as to the health of the child;

"(6) a statement as to the general prospects for or the barriers, if any, to the adoption of the child; and

"(7) a statement as to the various efforts taken by the moving party to locate the parent of the child.

"(d) When any facts required pursuant to subsection (c) of this section are not known to the moving party, if he or she shall so state in the motion, or on a motion by any party, for good cause shown, the judge may direct the filing of a bill of particulars to inform the moving party of the precise nature of the allegations contained in the motion for the termination of the parent and child relationship."
