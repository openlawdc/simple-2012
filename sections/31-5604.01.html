        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-42 repealed par. (13) which had read as follows:

"(13)(A) A security issued by an issuer registered as an open-end management investment company or unit investment trust under section 8 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 if:

"(i) The issuer is advised by an investment adviser that is a depository institution exempt from registration under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or that is currently registered as an investment adviser, and has been registered, or is affiliated with an adviser that has been registered, as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 for at least 3 years next preceding an offer or sale of a security claimed to be exempt under this subsection, and the issuer has acted, or is affiliated with an investment adviser that has acted, as investment adviser to one or more registered investment companies or unit investment trusts for at least 3 years next preceding an offer or sale of a security claimed to be exempt under this paragraph; or

"(ii) The issuer has a sponsor that has at all times throughout the 3 years before an offer or sale of a security claimed to be exempt under this paragraph sponsored one or more registered investment companies or unit investment trusts the aggregate total assets of which have exceeded $100 million.

"(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term 'sponsor' means the person responsible for the organization of the unit investment trust or who has continuing responsibilities for the administration of the affairs of the unit investment trust other than a trustee or custodian. The term 'sponsor' shall also include the depositor of the unit investment trust."
