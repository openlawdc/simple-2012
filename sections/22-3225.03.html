Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-144 rewrote section, which had read as follows:

"A person commits insurance fraud in the second degree if that person knowingly presents false information or conceals information regarding a material fact in any of the following:

"(1) Application for, rating of, or renewal of an insurance policy or reinsurance contract;

"(2) Claim for payment or benefit pursuant to an insurance policy or reinsurance contract;

"(3) Premiums paid on an insurance policy or reinsurance contract;

"(4) Payment made in accordance with the terms of an insurance policy or reinsurance contract;

"(5) Application used in a premium finance transaction;

"(6) Solicitation for sale of an insurance policy;

"(7) Application for a license or certificate of authority filed with the Commissioner or the chief insurance regulatory official of another jurisdiction;

"(8) Financial statement or condition of any insurer or reinsurer;

"(9) Acquisition, formation, merger, affiliation, reconsolidation, dissolution, or withdrawal from one or more lines of insurance or reinsurance in the District by an insurer or reinsurer;

"(10) Issuance of written evidence of insurance; or
