                <dd> The taxpayer has entered into an agreement to satisfy the liability by means of installment payments (unless the agreement provides otherwise); provided, that the Mayor shall not be required to release the levy if the release would jeopardize the status of the District of Columbia as a secured creditor;</dd>

                <dt>5</dt>
                <dd> The fair market value of the property exceeds the liability and release of the levy on part of the property will not hinder the collection of the liability.</dd>
