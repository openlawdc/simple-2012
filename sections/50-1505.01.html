Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-235 rewrote par. (2) which had read as follows:

"(2) The term 'motor vehicle' means any vehicle propelled by an internal-combustion engine and designed to carry passengers. The term 'motor vehicle' shall not include road rollers, farm tractors, trucks, motorcycles, motorized bicycles, vehicles with a seating capacity of 10 or more persons, vehicles propelled only upon stationary rails and tracks, and battery-operated wheelchairs when operated by a handicapped person at speeds not exceeding 10 miles per hour."

D.C. Law 15-105, in par. (2), validated a previously made technical correction.

D.C. Law 16-224, in par. (2), revived the provisions of D.C. Law 14-235 that expired on October 1, 2005, and substituted "personal mobility devices, as defined by <a href='./50-2201.02.html'>§ 50-2201.02(12)</a>, or a battery-operated wheelchair when operated by a person with a disability" for "electric personal assistive mobility devices, as defined by <a href='./50-2201.02.html'>§ 50-2201.02(12)</a>, and battery-operated wheelchairs when operated by a handicapped person at speeds not exceeding 10 miles per hour".
