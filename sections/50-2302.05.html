1973 Ed., <a href='./40-1113.html'>§ 40-1113</a>.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-289 rewrote the section, which had read:

"(a) In answer to a Notice of Infraction, a person to whom the notice was issued may:

"(1) Admit, by payment of the civil fine, the commission of the infraction; or

"(2) Deny the commission of the infraction.

"(b) Failure to answer within the time prescribed in subsection (d) of this section shall be deemed an admission to the commission of the infraction.

"(c) Any person appearing before a hearing examiner who refuses to enter an answer shall be deemed to have denied the infraction. Payment of fine for the infraction shall be deemed a finding of liability. A person admitting that an infraction occurred shall, at the same time he submits his answer, pay the civil fine and any additional penalties established pursuant to <a href='./50-2301.05.html'>§ 50-2301.05</a>, as may be due for failure to answer within the time required by subsection (d) of this section. In such case, such person need not appear at the hearing, unless the commission of such infraction would subject him to the suspension or revocation of his license or privilege to drive pursuant to Chapter II of Title 32 of the District of Columbia Rules and Regulations in which case he shall answer in person.

"(d)(1) A person to whom a notice of infraction has been issued must answer within 15 calendar days of the date the notice was issued or within a greater period of time as prescribed by the Director by regulation. If a person fails to answer such notice within this period, such person's operators' permit, in the case of a resident of the District or other person with a District operators' permit, or such person's privilege to drive within the District, in the case of a nonresident or resident licensed in another jurisdiction, shall by operation of law be suspended until such person answers the notice.

"(2) A notice of such suspension shall be personally served upon the respondent or left at his recorded address with a person of suitable age and discretion residing therein or shall be mailed by certified mail to him at his recorded address. Such suspension shall take effect 5 days after the personal service or the receipt of certified mail; provided, that refusal to accept personal service or delivery of certified mail shall be the equivalent of personal service or receipt of certified mail, if, immediately upon advice of such refusal, the Director causes a copy of the notice to be sent to the respondent by regular mail with a statement that, despite such refusal, the suspension will go into effect 5 days from the date the notice was sent by regular mail.

"(3) A person who fails to answer within the prescribed period referred to in subsection (a) (1) of this section shall answer by personal appearance unless permitted by regulation by the Director to answer by other means."

D.C. Law 15-307, in subsec. (f), substituted "307.7" for "307.6".

D.C. Law 16-117, designated the existing text of subsec. (b) as par. (b)(1); and added pars. (b)(2) and (b)(3).

D.C. Law 16-279 rewrote subsecs. (d), (e), and (f), which formerly read:

"(d)(1) A person to whom a notice of infraction has been issued must answer within 30 calendar days of date the notice was issued or within a greater period of time as prescribed by the Director by regulation.

"(2) If a person fails to answer the notice within this 30 day period, the person's operator's permit, in the case of a resident of the District or a person with a District operator's permit, or the person's privilege to drive within the District, in the case of a nonresident or resident licensed in another jurisdiction, shall be suspended by operation of law pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.

"(e) If a person fails to answer the notice within 60 days after the date the notice was issued, or within a greater period of time as prescribed by the Director by regulation, the commission of the infraction shall be deemed admitted and all points, penalties, and fines shall be assessed. Not more than 50 days after the notice is issued, the Director shall send, by regular mail, notice of the outstanding notice of infraction and of the impending deemed admission. The notice may be combined with the notice of suspension described in subsection (f) of this section.

"(f) A notice of the suspension provided for in subsection (d) of this section shall be sent by regular mail to the respondent's address on the Department's records. Suspensions shall take effect 15 days after the date the notice was sent. The possession by the Department of a copy of a suspension notice addressed to a respondent, or a copy of the certificate or affidavit provided for in 18 DCMR 307.7, establishes a rebuttable presumption that the notice, as written, was received by the respondent by the date the suspension became effective."
