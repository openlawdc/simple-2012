Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-135, in the section name line added "notice; great weight; access to documents; reports; contributions", and rewrote the section, which formerly read:

For the purposes of this act, proposed actions of District government policy shall be the same as those for which prior notice of proposed rulemaking is required pursuant to § 1-1506(a) or as pertains to the Council of the District of Columbia.

"(b) Thirty days written notice of such District government actions or proposed actions shall be given by mail to each Commission affected by said actions, except where shorter notice on good cause made and published with the notice may be provided or in the case of an emergency and such notice shall be published in the District of Columbia Register. The Register shall be made available, without cost, to each Commission.

"(c)(1) Proposed District government actions covered by this act shall include, but shall not be limited to, actions of the Council of the District of Columbia, the executive branch, or independent agency. In addition to those notices required in subsection (a) of this section, each agency, board and commission shall, before the award of any grant funds to a citizen organization or group, or before the formulation of any final policy decision or guideline with respect to grant applications, comprehensive plans, requested or proposed zoning changes, variances, public improvements, licenses, or permits affecting said Commission area, the District budget and city goals, and priorities, proposed changes in District government service delivery, and the opening of any proposed facility systems, provide to each affected Commission notice of the proposed action as required by subsection (b) of this section.
