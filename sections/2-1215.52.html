        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-91 made a technical change in the enacting clause of D.C. Law 15- 257 which resulted in no change in text.

D.C. Law 17-212 added subsec. (b)(3); and rewrote subsec. (c), which had read as follows:

"(c) The BID taxes for nonexempt real properties in the Golden Triangle BID shall be:

"(1) Eleven cents for each net rentable square foot of improved Class 4 Property, excluding parking lots and above grade parking structures, for any property where the owner is required to report net rentable area to the Office of Taxation and Revenue or where the Office of Taxation and Revenue has records indicating the net rentable area of the property. Net rentable square feet shall be the number of net rentable square feet reported to or on record with the District and shall be calculated using any method that is recognized generally in the District Metropolitan area as an appropriate method for measuring space in agreements between landlords and tenants;

"(2) Eleven cents for each equivalent net rentable square foot of improvements of improved Class 4 Property, excluding parking lots and parking structures for any property where the owner is not required to report net rentable area to the Office of Taxation and Revenue and where the Office of Taxation and Revenue maintains no record of net rentable area. Equivalent net rentable area shall be 90% of the gross building area. For purposes of this paragraph, gross building area shall exclude parking facilities and shall be determined using any method that is recognized generally in the District metropolitan area as an appropriate method for measuring gross building area;

"(3) Eight cents for each equivalent net rentable square foot of improvements of Class 3 Property. Equivalent net rentable areas shall be calculated as set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection;

"(4) Six cents for each equivalent net rentable square foot of class 4 above-grade parking structures consisting of one or more stories. Equivalent net rentable area shall be calculated as set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection;

"(5) Six cents for each square foot of land for Class 5 Property and improved parking lots located in Class 4 Property without parking structures as defined in paragraph (4) of this subsection; and
