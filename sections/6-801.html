The person or persons so notified shall be allowed until 12:00 noon of the day following the service of such notice in which to commence the securing or removal of the same; and he or they shall employ sufficient labor to remove or secure the said building or excavation as expeditiously as can be done; provided, however, that in a case where the public safety requires immediate action the Mayor may enter upon the premises, with such workmen and assistants as may be necessary, and cause the said unsafe structure or excavation to be shored up, taken down, or otherwise secured without delay, and a proper fence or boarding to be put up for the protection of passersby.</dd>

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-281 added subsecs. (c-2) and (c-3).

Legislative History of Laws

Law 13-281, the "Abatement and Condemnation of Nuisance Properties Omnibus Amendment Act of 2000", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 13-646, which was referred to the Committee on Consumer and Regulatory Affairs.  The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on December 5, 2000, and December 19, 2000, respectively.   Signed by the Mayor on January 22, 2000, it was assigned Act No. 13-78 and transmitted to Both Houses of Congress for its review.  D.C. Law 13-281 became effective on April 27, 2001.

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, § 711 (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.11.html'>§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.14.html'>§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.

Miscellaneous Notes

Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Square 6126: Title II, §<a href='./201-205.html'>§ 201-205</a>, of D.C. Law 8-229 gave the Mayor powers to make an immediate determination of nature and cost of remedial actions for sediment control in Square 6126, power to undertake such actions, power to prohibit activities in Square 6126, power to enter private property to carry out the actions, and power to levy an assessment on the property in Square 6126; however, expenditure of funds for remedial actions or permanent improvements other than in Square 6126 is not authorized, nor is any claim or right of relief for such actions created in any person by title II.
