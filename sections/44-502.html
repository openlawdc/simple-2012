1981 Ed., § 32-1302.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-38, in subsec. (j), substituted "Public Health:  Health Care Facility endorsement or Public Health:  Human Services facility endorsement to a basic business license under the basic" for "Class A Public Health:  Health Care Facility endorsement or Class A Public Health:   Human Services facility endorsement to a master business license under the master".

D.C. Law 15-354, in subsec. (j), validated a previously made technical correction.

Emergency Act Amendments

Editor's Notes

Because of the enactment of subchapter II of this chapter by D.C. Law 12-238 and the designation of the preexisting text as subchapter I, "subchapter" has been substituted for "chapter" near the beginning of (b), twice in the last sentence of (d) and (g), and in (h).
