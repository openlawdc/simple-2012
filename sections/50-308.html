Legislative History of Laws

For legislative history of D.C. Law 6-97, see Historical and Statutory Notes following <a href='./50-301.html'>§ 50-301</a>.

For legislative history of D.C. Law 7-109, see Historical and Statutory Notes following <a href='./50-306.html'>§ 50-306</a>.

Law 10-171, the "District of Columbia Taxicab Commission Establishment Act of 1985 Amendment Act of 1994," was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 10-538, which was referred to the Committee on Public Services and Youth Affairs. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on June 21, 1994, and July 5, 1994, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on July 25, 1994, it was assigned Act No. 10-291 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 10-171 became effective on September 22, 1994.

Effective Dates

Section 24(b) of D.C. Law 6-97 provided that sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, and 23 shall take effect 1 year after March 25, 1986.

Miscellaneous Notes

Law 19-184 repealed this section only "upon the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan, as certified by the Chief Financial Officer to the Budget Director of the Council in a certification published by the Council in the District of Columbia Register." As of the most recent updated publication of this section, the certification required for Law 19-184 has not been made. Therefore the repeal has not been incorporated into this section.
