D.C. Law 13-305 rewrote the section which had read:

"(a) There is imposed on each transferor for each transfer at the time the deed is submitted to the Mayor for recordation a tax at the rate of 1.1% of the consideration for such transfer; provided, that in any case where application of the rate of tax to the consideration for the transfer results in a total tax of less than $1 the tax shall be $1.

"(c) The transferor in a transfer shall have responsibility for payment of the taxes imposed by this section; provided, however, that if the transferor should fail to make payment the transferee shall be jointly and severally liable with the transferor for payment of said taxes. Neither the United States nor the District of Columbia governments shall be subject to liability for the tax imposed under this section.

"(d) The Mayor is authorized to prescribe, by regulation, reasonable extensions of time for the filing of the return required by subsection (b) of this section."

D.C. Law 14-42, in subsec.

"(2) The real property qualifies as a homestead as defined by <a href='./47-849.html'>§ 47-849</a> (2), the application for the homestead deduction accompanies the deed, and the deed is recorded timely as provided by <a href='./47-1431.html'>§ 47-1431(a)</a>.

"(a-2) The rate in subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be subject to reduction in accordance with <a href='./47-368.03.html'>§ 47-368.03</a>."

"(a-4) Beginning October 1, 2006, except for residential properties transferred for a consideration less than $400,000, an additional tax of .35% is imposed upon a deed that is subject to the tax under subsection (a)(1) of this section.
