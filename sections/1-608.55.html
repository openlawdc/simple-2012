"(2) After consulting with the sending agency head, transfer an attorney employed by a subordinate agency to any other subordinate agency, including the Office of the Corporation Counsel, with the approval of the head of the receiving agency, unless the Corporation Counsel has delegated the direction, supervision, and control of the attorney to the head of the agency that employs the attorney."
