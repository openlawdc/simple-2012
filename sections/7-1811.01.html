        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-172 rewrote this section, which previously read:

"Establishment of Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund.

" (a) There is established within the General Fund of the District of Columbia, a trust fund designated as the Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund ('Fund'), to which shall be credited, without regard to fiscal year limitation, all revenue owed and accruing to the District from the proceeds of the tobacco litigation settlement, except for the first $16.05 million recognized as general fund revenue and already included in the base budget in FY 2000, and except for the second $16.05 million which is allocated first to the reserve to replace funds allocated from the reserve to the fund pursuant to title XX of this act. The Fund shall be continuing. Revenues deposited into the Fund shall not revert to the General Fund at the end of any fiscal year or at any other time, but shall be continually available, subject to authorization by Congress in an appropriations act.

"(b) Tobacco settlement monies received, or deposited into the Fund shall be used for the purposes set forth in legislation adopted by the Council."

D.C. Law 14-300, in subsec. (a)(1)(C), substituted "by law, which shall include funds to be deposited into a Reservation 13 Benefit Area ('R13BA') Hospital account or R13BA Health Care account (collectively, 'R13BA funds') pursuant to Chapter 15 of Title 10" for "by law."

D.C. Law 15-69, in subpar. (1)(C) of subsec. (a), substituted "Health Care account ('R13BA fund)" for "Hospital account or R13BA Health Care account (collectively, 'R13BA funds')", and made a technical correction that required no change in the text.

D.C. Law 15-354, in subsec. (a)(1)(C), validated a previously made technical correction.

D.C. Law 16-142, in subpar. (a)(1)(A)(i), substituted a semicolon for "; and"; in subpar. (a)(1)(A)(ii), substituted "<a href='./7-1831.02.html'>§ 7-1831.02</a>; and" for "<a href='./7-1831.02.html'>§ 7- 1831.02</a>;"; added subpars. (a)(1)(A)(iii) and (a)(1)(B-i); added subsec. (c); and rewrote subpar. (a)(1)(B), which had read as follows:

(B)" All payments received with respect to the Residual Interest, as the term is defined in <a href='./7-1831.01.html'>§ 7-1831.01(7)</a>; and"

D.C. Law 17-353 validated a previously made technical correction in subsec. (a)(1)(B).
