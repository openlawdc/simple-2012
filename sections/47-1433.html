Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-282 rewrote subsec. (c) which had read as follows:

"(c) If a person other than a dealer fails to record, as required by <a href='./47-1431.html'>§ 47-1431</a>, there shall be imposed on the person a penalty in the amount of $250. Whenever it is shown by such person that failure to record was due to reasonable cause and was not due to knowing omission or neglect, the Mayor may waive part of or all of the penalty fee provided by this subsection. In every case of a partial or total waiver, the reason for the waiver shall be stated clearly on a public record determined by the Mayor."
