                <dd> Any transfer of custodial property as now defined in this act made before the effective date of the District of Columbia Uniform Transfers to Minors Act is validated notwithstanding that there was no specific authority in the District of Columbia Uniform Gifts to Minors Act for the coverage of custodial property of that kind or for a transfer from that source at the time the transfer was made.</dd>
