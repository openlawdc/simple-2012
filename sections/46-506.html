Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-79 rewrote subsec. (b) which had read as follows:

"(b) If a provision of a premarital agreement modifies or eliminates spousal support and that modification or elimination causes 1 party to the agreement to be eligible for support under a program of public assistance at the time of separation or marital dissolution, a court, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement, may require the other party to provide support to the extent necessary to avoid that eligibility."

D.C. Law 17-231, in subsec. (b), substituted "pursuant to § 32-702(d)," for "under § 32-702,".
