Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-172, in subsec. (a), substituted "120 days" for "60 days" and deleted ", or the application shall be deemed approved by the Mayor" at the end of the second sentence, and in subsec. (b), struck the second and third sentences, which had read:

"The hearing by the Review Board upon the filing of an application to designate a historic landmark shall be conducted under the contested case procedures contained in <a href='./1-1509.html'>§ 1-1509</a>. Any final order of the Mayor under this act and any final order of the Review Board regarding the designation of a historic landmark shall be reviewable in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals."

D.C. Law 13-313, in subsec. (a), substituted "alteration, subdivision," for "subdivision".

Editor's Notes

Because of the codification of D.C. Law 5-69 as subchapter II of this chapter, and the designation of the preexisting text of Chapter 11 as subchapter I, "subchapter" has been substituted for "chapter," where applicable, in this section.

Miscellaneous Notes

Section 20(c) of D.C. Law 13-313, amends D.C. Law 13-172 by adding a new section 403a which provides:

Sec. 403a. Applicability

"Section 403(a) and (b)(1)(A) and (B) shall apply only prospectively to hearings held by the Mayor or the Historic Preservation Board after the effective date of this title."
