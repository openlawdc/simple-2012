For the purposes of this part, and subchapter I of Chapter 10 of this title, actions of an agent acting for a candidate shall be imputed to the candidate; provided, that the actions of the agent may not be imputed to the candidate in the presence of a provision of law requiring a willful and knowing violation of this part or subchapter I of Chapter 10 of this title unless the agency relationship to engage in the act is shown by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
