The bylaws may also provide that if any member has failed to patronize the association during a period of time specified in the bylaws, the directors may use the reserve funds to recall all the member's holdings and thereupon the member shall cease to be a member of the association. When so recalled, the certificates of share or membership capital shall be either reissued or canceled.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n2001 Ed., § 29-927.\n\n1981 Ed., § 29-1127.\n\n1973 Ed., § 29-827.\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nFor history of Law 18-378, see notes under § 29-101.01.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\nFormer § 29-927 has been recodified as § 29A-927.\n\nDC CODE § 29-927\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(July 2, 2011, D.C.
