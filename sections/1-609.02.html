"Each person holding an excepted appointment under the authority of this section and §<a href='./1-609.01.html'>§ 1-609.01</a> and 1-609.03 is intended to be an individual whose primary duties are of a policy determining, confidential, or policy advocacy character and who reports directly to the head of an agency. No person holding an Excepted Service appointment pursuant to §<a href='./1-609.03.html'>§ 1-609.03</a> or 1-609.08 may be appointed to a position in the Career, Management Supervisory, or Educational Service during the 6 month period immediately preceding a Mayoral election. However, upon termination, a person with Career or Educational Service status may retreat, at the discretion of the terminating personnel authority, within 3 months to a vacant position in such service for which he or she is qualified. The provisions of this section shall not apply to employees of the Council of the District of Columbia."
