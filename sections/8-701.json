The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on December 4, 2001, and February 5, 2002, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on February 25, 2002, it was assigned Act No. 14-268 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 14-116 became effective on May 2, 2002.\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402(139) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nNew implementing regulations: Pursuant to this section, the following new regulations were adopted in 1983: The \"Solid Waste Regulations Amendments Act of 1983\" (D.C. Law 5-20, August 2, 1983, 30 DCR 3331).\n\nDC CODE § 8-701\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Mar. 2, 1895, 28 Stat. 758, ch. 176; May 2, 2002, D.C.
