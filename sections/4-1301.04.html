The Agency shall immediately commence a social investigation.

"(c) In all cases occurring after normal working hours or when it is otherwise deemed necessary, the Agency may request the assistance of the police."

"(c) The initial phase of the investigation shall:

"(1) Be completed within 24 hours of its commencement;

"(2) Include notification and coordination with the Metropolitan Police Department when there is indication of a crime, including sexual or serious physical abuse; and

The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of October 10, 2012, that the fiscal effect of Title III of Law 18-228 has been included in an approved budget and financial plan.
