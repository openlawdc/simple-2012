In any such case the savings bank, savings company, banking institution, or trust company shall be obligated to transfer to surplus the amount so paid into such retirement fund for such period, on account of the preferred stock or debentures as such stock or debentures are retired.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., ยง 26-106.\n\n1973 Ed., ยง 26-106.\n\nDC CODE ยง 26-106\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Aug. 23, 1935, 49 Stat. 720, ch. 614, ยง 337.)","sections":[],"division":{"identifier":"V","text":"Local Business Affairs"},"title":{"identifier":"26","text":"Banks and Other Financial Institutions.
