If possession is not delivered when so demanded, the plaintiff may apply to the court without notice, unless the court requires notice to be given, for a writ of assistance, and the court, upon proof of the service of the copy of the final order or judgment and certificate of the clerk showing payment as referred to in this section, shall thereupon cause the writ to be issued, which shall be executed in the same manner as when issued in other cases for the delivery of possession of real property.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., ยง 16-1367.\n\n1973 Ed., ยง 16-1367.\n\nDC CODE ยง 16-1367\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Dec. 23, 1963, 77 Stat. 581, Pub.
