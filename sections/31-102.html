Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-166 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"Pursuant to § 1-204.04(b), the Council establishes the Department of Insurance and Securities Regulation as a cabinet level agency of the executive branch of the Government of the District of Columbia, under the supervision of the Commissioner of Insurance and Securities."
