"For the purposes of this subchapter, the term:

"(1) 'Categorical pretreatment standards' or 'Categorical standards' means any regulation promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency ('EPA') which specifies quantities or concentrations of pollutants or pollutant properties which may be discharged to a POTW by existing or new industrial users in specific industrial categories.

"(1A) 'Clean Water Act' means the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.).

"(1B) 'CFR' means the Code of Federal Regulations.

"(2) 'Discharge' means any solid, liquid, or gas introduced into the wastewater system.

"(3) 'District' means the District of Columbia.

"(3A) 'Industrial user' means a non-domestic user who discharges, causes, or permits the discharge of wastewater into the District's wastewater system.

"(4) 'Interference' means the inhibition or disruption of the District's wastewater system processes or operations which causes, may cause, or contributes to a violation of any requirement of the District's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, or which threatens life, property, or environment.
