The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on April 6, 1982, and May 11, 1982, respectively.

Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nTransfer of Functions\n\n\"National Capital Planning Commission\" was substituted for \"National Capital Park and Planning Commission\" in paragraph (10) of this section in view of the Act of June 6, 1924, ch. 270, § 9, as added by the Act of July 19, 1952, 66 Stat. 790, ch. 949, § 1, which transferred the functions, powers, and duties of the National Capital Park and Planning Commission to the National Capital Planning Commission.\n\nDC CODE § 6-301.02\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Aug. 2, 1946, 60 Stat. 791, ch. 736, § 3; Aug. 28, 1958, 72 Stat. 1102, Pub.
