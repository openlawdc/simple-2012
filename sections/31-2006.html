                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> With respect to a life insurer, the Commissioner shall take such actions as are necessary to place the insurer under regulatory control under Chapter 13 of this title.  In that event, the Mandatory Control Level Event shall be deemed sufficient grounds for the Commissioner to take action under Chapter 13 of this title, and the Commissioner shall have the rights, powers, and duties with respect to the insurer as are set forth in Chapter 13 of this title.  If the Commissioner takes actions pursuant to an Adjusted RBC Report, the insurer shall be entitled to the protections of Chapter 13 of this title pertaining to summary proceedings.   Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Commissioner may forego action for up to 90 days after the Mandatory Control Level Event if the Commissioner finds there is a reasonable expectation that the Mandatory Control Level Event may be eliminated within the 90-day period.</dd>

                <dd> With respect to a property and casualty insurer, the Commissioner shall take such actions as are necessary to place the insurer under regulatory control under Chapter 13 of this title, or, in the case of an insurer which is writing no business and which is running-off its existing business, may allow the insurer to continue its run-off under the supervision of the Commissioner. In either event, the Mandatory Control Level Event shall be deemed sufficient grounds for the Commissioner to take action under Chapter 13 of this title, and the Commissioner shall have the rights, powers and duties with respect to the insurer as are set forth in Chapter 13 of this title. If the Commissioner takes actions pursuant to an Adjusted RBC Report, the insurer shall be entitled to the protections of Chapter 13 of this title pertaining to summary proceedings. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Commissioner may forego action for up to 90 days after the Mandatory Control Level Event if the Commissioner finds there is a reasonable expectation that the Mandatory Control Level Event may be eliminated within the 90-day period.</dd>
