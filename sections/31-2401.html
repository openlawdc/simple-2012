                <dd> The average motor vehicle insurance policy in the District will pay only up to $10,000 for the personal injuries of any 1 victim, a sum that is insufficient to compensate adequately a victim with serious injuries; and</dd>

                <dd> Satisfaction of the prerequisites to compensation under the present law is time-consuming and expensive to policyholders because a victim must establish that the accident was the fault of another person; that the person injured was free from contributory fault; and that the injuries suffered were the natural and probable consequences of the accident.</dd>

                <dd> The purchase of this better insurance protection should be compulsory because of the great potential of a motor vehicle to cause personal injury.</dd>
