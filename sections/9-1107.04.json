Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia.

Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nDC CODE § 9-1107.04\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(July 13, 1972, 86 Stat. 466, Pub.
