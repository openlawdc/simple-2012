Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nOrder establishing Board for the Condemnation of Insanitary Buildings: See Organization Order No. 102, 54-2034, dated September 27, 1954, as amended March 18, 1958, June 10, 1958, May 26, 1960, July 5, 1960, March 23, 1970, May 25, 1970, July 27, 1971, September 20, 1983, and by Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1975.\n\nOrder establishing Condemnation Review Board: See Organization Order No. 103, dated September 27, 1954, as amended April 23, 1957, and July 14, 1960.\n\nShort title of subtitle F of title II of Law 15-205: Section 2071 of D.C.
