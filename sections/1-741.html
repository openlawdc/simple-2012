Notice of the time, place, and subject matter of the public hearing shall be published in the D.C. Register at least 15 days in advance of its scheduled date in order to afford interested persons an opportunity to present their views. The proposed exemption shall be published in the D.C.

                <dd> Unless the Council disapproves the proposed exemption submitted under subsection (h) of this section by resolution within 30 days of receipt by the Council, the exemption shall be deemed approved. If a resolution of disapproval has been introduced by at least one member of the Council within the 5-day period (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) following its receipt, the period of Council review shall be extended by an additional 15 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) from the date of its receipt.

                <dd> The interest of all Funds in the separate account or collective investment fund does not exceed 5% of the total of all assets in the account or fund; and</dd>
