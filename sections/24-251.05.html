                <dd> The reporter's assessment of the circumstances or events in relation to the resident's correctional goals; and</dd>

                <dd> Copies of all executed furlough release authorization forms shall be kept in the office of the Administrator. Within 5 calendar days before the beginning of each month, the information on these forms (in digested form) will be reported to the designee of the Director. These reports will include:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> The name and Department number of each resident who has been granted a furlough during the reporting period;</dd>

                <dt>4</dt>
                <dd> The beginning and ending dates of the furlough;</dd>
            
                <dt>5</dt>
                <dd> The name of the officer authorizing the furlough;</dd>
            
                <dt>6</dt>
                <dd> The number of furloughs previously granted to such resident; and</dd>
