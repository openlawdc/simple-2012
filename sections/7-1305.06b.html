The District's petition shall request the type of guardianship which is least restrictive to the incapacitated individual in duration and scope, taking into account the incapacitated individual's current mental and adaptive limitations or other conditions warranting the procedure. This subsection does not preclude any other party from petitioning the Court for appointment of a guardian.</dd>
