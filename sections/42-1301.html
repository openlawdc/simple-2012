Legislative History of Laws

Law 12-263, the "Residential Real Property Seller Disclosure, Funeral Services Date Change, and Public Service Commission Independent Procurement Authority Act of 1998," was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 12-648, which was referred to the Committee on Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. The Bill was adopted on first, amended first and second readings on October 6 1998, November 10, 1998, and December 1, 1998, respectively. Bill 12-648 was vetoed by the Mayor on December 29, 1998, and the Council overrode the veto on January 5, 1999, whereupon the Bill was assigned Act No. 12-625 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 12-263 became effective on April 20, 1999.
