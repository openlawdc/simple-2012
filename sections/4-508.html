                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> Claimant knowingly or willingly participated in the commission of the crime which forms the basis for the claim; provided, that a claimant who was a minor and a victim of sex trafficking of children, may be awarded compensation; or</dd>

                <dd> An application for assistance may be denied, in whole or in part, if the Court finds:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>

                <dd> The claimant failed to provide information to a requesting law enforcement agency or did not reasonably cooperate with law enforcement officials in apprehending the offender. Refusal of a victim or claimant to testify against the offender may be excused if testifying would subject the victim or claimant to a substantial risk of serious physical or emotional injury.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, if the victim is found to have willingly or knowingly participated, consented, provoked, or incited the crime, a secondary victim is not automatically precluded from compensation.</dd>
            
                <dt>d</dt>
