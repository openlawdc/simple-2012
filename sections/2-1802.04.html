Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-281 rewrote subsec. (b) which had read:

"(b) The Mayor may prepare a listing of delinquent respondents who have not paid or appealed within 15 days of service, fines, penalties, or costs resulting from final decisions issued by attorney examiners and may periodically publish such a list in one or more general circulation newspapers published in the District of Columbia."

D.C. Law 15-354, in subsec. (a), substituted "Except as provided in <a href='./2-1831.03.html'>§ 2- 1831.03(f)</a>), the" for "The".
