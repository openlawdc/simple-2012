Interest shall accrue on the amount due at the rate of 1 1/2 % a month.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>

                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> The Mayor shall record a real property tax lien, captioned "Notice of Converted Real Property Tax Lien", with the Recorder of Deeds and in accordance with <a href='./47-1340.html'>§ 47-1340</a>. The real property tax lien shall be deemed a delinquent real property tax from the date of the conversion, shall accrue interest at the rate of interest charged for delinquent real property tax, and shall be perpetual. Payment thereof shall be credited to the General Fund of the District of Columbia. The real property may be sold at tax sale, regardless of the date of the conversion, in the same manner, under the same conditions, and subject to the same impositions of interest, costs, expenses, fees, and other charges, as real property sold for delinquent real property tax.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> The aggregate amount of the costs, expenses, penalties, and interest secured by the lien imposed under subsection (a) of this section may appear on a real property tax bill, and the aggregate amount shall:</dd>
            
                <dt>A</dt>
                <dd> Be deemed an additional real property tax to be collected in the same manner and under the same conditions as real property tax is collected, including the sale of the real property for delinquent tax; and</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> Be subject to the same penalty and interest provisions as delinquent real property tax is subject as of the date of such real property tax bill.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> The lien under subsection (a) of this section, with penalty and interest as provided under this section, shall be converted to real property tax as of the due date for payment of the real property tax bill if payment is not made.</dd>
            
                <dt>d</dt>
                <dd> If the lien has been converted to a real property tax lien under <a href='./47-1340.html'>§ 47- 1340</a> or if the accrued amount of the lien appears on the real property tax bill, the real property tax lien shall be enforced under Chapter 13A of Title 47.</dd>
