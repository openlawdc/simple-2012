Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 18-321 repealed subsecs. (b) and (d); and, in subsec. (c), substituted "action" for "action for libel or slander". Prior to repeal, subsecs. (b) and (d) read as follows:

"(b) No discriminatory, disciplinary, or retaliatory action shall be taken against an employee of a long-term care facility or agency, resident, or representative of the program, for any communication made to aid the program in carrying out its duties and responsibilities, unless the communication was made maliciously or in bad faith. This subsection shall not be construed to infringe upon the rights of an employer to supervise, discipline, or terminate an employee for other reasons."

"(d) A court may order the disclosure of information made confidential under this chapter, if it determines that the disclosure is necessary to enforce this chapter."
