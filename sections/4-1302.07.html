D.C. Law 14-206 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"<a href='./4-1302.07.html'>§ 4-1302.07</a>. Expungement.

"(a) The staff which maintains the Child Protection Register shall expunge from each report all information that identifies any person in the report upon:

"(1) The 18th birthday of the child, if there is no reasonable suspicion or evidence that a younger sibling is being abused or neglected; or

"(2) The end of the 5th year after the termination of the social rehabilitation services directed toward the abuse and neglect, whichever occurs first.

"(b) The staff which maintains the Child Protection Register shall expunge, pursuant to the rules adopted under <a href='./4-1302.06.html'>§ 4-1302.06</a>, material successfully challenged as incorrect."
