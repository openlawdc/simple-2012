Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-192 redesignated former subsecs. (a), (b), and (c) as pars. (1), (2), and (3) of subsec. (a); and added subsec. (b).

D.C. Law 16-279 rewrote subsec. (a)(3) [redesignated from subsec. (c) by Law 16-192], which formerly read:

"(c) Upon receipt of the applicant's certification that the issuance of the license or permit is not prohibited by this subchapter, the District government shall proceed to consider the application as otherwise provided by law."

D.C. Law 17-353 validated a previously made technical correction in subsec. (a)(3).
