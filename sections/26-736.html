                <dd> A District state bank ("applicant") desiring to establish and maintain a branch in another state under this section shall file an application on a form provided by the Superintendent and pay a merger fee to be determined by the Superintendent. If, within 30 days of receipt of the application, the Superintendent determines that the applicant possesses sufficient financial resources, sufficient managerial and professional experience, and that the proposed merger is in the public interest, the Superintendent shall approve the application for an interstate merger transaction and for the operation of branches in a state other than the District by the District state bank.</dd>

                <dd> A District state bank that establishes and maintains a branch in a state other than the District pursuant to an interstate merger transaction may exercise, at such branch, all rights and powers permitted to banks chartered by that state unless the Superintendent determines that the exercise of such rights or powers would threaten the safety and soundness of the District state bank.</dd>
