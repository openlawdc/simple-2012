Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-217 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"If a return required by this chapter is not filed, or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, the amount of tax due shall be determined by the Mayor from such information as may be obtainable. Notice of such determination shall be given to the taxpayer. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within 30 days after the giving of notice of such determination, shall apply in writing to the Mayor for a hearing, or unless the Mayor of his own motion shall redetermine the same. After such hearing or redetermination the Mayor shall give notice of his final determination to the person against whom the tax is assessed."
