        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 18-55 rewrote par. (5), which had read as follows:

"(5) 'District gross receipts' means all income derived from any activity whatsoever from sources within the District, other than income of a feepayer derived from an ownership or beneficial interest in other feepayers subject to the ballpark fee, whether compensated in the District or not, prior to the deduction of any expense whatsoever connected with the production of the income, except that beginning with the ballpark fee that is required by this chapter to be paid in fiscal year 2005 and thereafter, the calculation of the income shall not include the collection of federal or local taxes on motor vehicle fuel."

D.C. Law 18-341, in par. (6), designated the lead-in text as subpar. (A), redesignated former subpars. (A), (B), and (C) as sub-subpars. (i), (ii), and (iii), and added subpar. (B).

Legislative History of Laws

Miscellaneous Notes

Although Law 18-341 did not contain a provision requiring that the fiscal effect of Law 18-341 be included in an approved budget and financial plan in order for Law 18 -341 to apply as law, the Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of February 15, 2012, that the fiscal effect of Law 18-341 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 18- 341, are not in effect.
