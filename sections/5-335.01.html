                <dd> For the purposes of this section, the term "post-and-forfeit procedure" shall mean the procedure enforced as part of the criminal justice system in the District of Columbia whereby a person charged with certain misdemeanors may simultaneously post and forfeit an amount as collateral (which otherwise would serve as security upon release to ensure the arrestee's appearance at trial) and thereby obtain a full and final resolution of the criminal charge.</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> The resolution of a criminal charge using the post-and-forfeit procedure is not a conviction of a crime and shall not be equated to a criminal conviction. The fact that a person resolved a charge using the post-and-forfeit procedure may not be relied upon by any court of the District of Columbia or any agency of the District of Columbia in any subsequent criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding or administrative action to impose any sanction, penalty, enhanced sentence, or civil disability.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> Whenever the Metropolitan Police Department ("MPD") or the Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia tenders an offer to an arrestee to resolve a criminal charge using the post-and-forfeit procedure, the offer shall be accompanied with a written notice provided to the arrestee describing the post-and-forfeit procedure and the consequences of resolving the criminal charge using this procedure.</dd>
            
                <dt>d</dt>
                <dd> The written notice required by subsection (c) of this section shall include, at a minimum, the following information:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> The identity of the misdemeanor crime that is to be resolved using the post-and-forfeit procedure and the amount of collateral that is to be posted and forfeited;</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> A statement that the arrestee has the right to choose whether to accept the post-and-forfeit offer or, alternatively, proceed with the criminal case and a potential adjudication on the merits of the criminal charge;</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> If the arrestee is in custody, a statement that if the arrestee elects to proceed with the criminal case he or she may also be eligible for prompt release on citation, or will be promptly brought to court for determination of bail;</dd>
            
                <dt>4</dt>
                <dd> A statement that the resolution of the criminal charge using the post-and-forfeit procedure will preclude the arrestee from obtaining an adjudication on the merits of the criminal charge;</dd>
            
                <dt>5</dt>
                <dd> A statement that the resolution of the criminal charge using the post-and-forfeit procedure is not a conviction of a crime and may not be equated to a criminal conviction, and may not result in the imposition of any sanction, penalty, enhanced sentence, or civil disability by any court of the District of Columbia or any agency of the District of Columbia in any subsequent criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding or administrative action;</dd>
            
                <dt>6</dt>
                <dd> A statement that the agreement to resolve the charge using the post-and-forfeit procedure is final after the expiration of 90 days from the date the notice is signed and that, within the 90-day period, the arrestee or the Office of the Attorney General may file a motion with the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to set aside the forfeiture and proceed with the criminal case; and</dd>
            
                <dt>7</dt>
                <dd> A statement that, following resolution of the charge using the post-and-forfeit procedure, the arrestee will continue to have an arrest record for the charge at issue, unless the arrestee successfully moves in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to seal his or her arrest record.</dd>
            
                <dt>e</dt>
                <dd> The notice required by subsection (c) of this section shall be offered in the Spanish language to those persons who require or desire notice in this manner, and shall be offered in other languages as is reasonable to ensure meaningful access to the notice for persons who are limited English proficient.</dd>
            
                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd> An arrestee provided the written notice required by subsection (c) of this section who wishes to resolve the criminal charge using the post-and-forfeit procedure shall, after reading the notice, sign the bottom of the notice, thereby acknowledging the information provided in the notice and agreeing to accept the offer to resolve the charge using the post-and-forfeit procedure. After the arrestee signs the notice, the arrestee shall be provided with a copy of the signed notice.</dd>
            
                <dt>g</dt>
                <dd> Within 90 days of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia issuing an updated bond and collateral list, the Chief of Police shall issue a list of all misdemeanor charges that MPD members are authorized to resolve using the post-and-forfeit procedure, and the collateral amount associated with each charge. The Chief shall make the list available to the public, including placing the list on the MPD website.</dd>
            
                <dt>h</dt>
                <dd> The Mayor shall submit an annual public report to the Council identifying the total amount of money collected the previous year pursuant to the post-and-forfeit procedure and the number of criminal charges, by specific charge, resolved the previous year using the post-and-forfeit procedure. The data shall be reported separately for instances in which the post-and-forfeit procedure is independently used by the MPD (without the approval, on a case-by-case basis, of either the Office of the Attorney General or the Superior Court of the District of Columbia), and for all other instances in which the post-and-forfeit procedure is used. The report also shall identify the fund or funds in which the post-and-forfeit moneys were placed.</dd>
