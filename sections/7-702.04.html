Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 18-321 rewrote subsecs. (a)(1), (4), (6); repealed subsec. (a)(10); in subsec. (a)(11), substituted "Establish a uniform system to record data on complaints and conditions relating to long-term care services;" for "Establish a system for coordinating a uniform District-wide system to record data on complaints and conditions in long-term care facilities;"; and, in subsec. (a)(13), substituted "conditions exist that adversely affect residents' health, safety, welfare, or rights;" for ""conditions which adversely affect the health, safety, welfare, or rights of a resident exist within the long-term care facility;". Prior to amendment or repeal, subsecs. (a)(1), (4), (6), and (10) read as follows:

"(1) Investigate and resolve complaints and concerns made by or on behalf of older persons and other residents in the District;"

"(4) Submit annually, to the Office on Aging for submission to the Council and the Mayor, a written report documenting the complaints received and resolved, and recommending policy, regulatory, or legislative changes;"

"(6) Establish and implement program policies and procedures for eliciting, receiving, investigating, verifying, referring, and resolving complaints of residents;"

"(10) Report any instance of suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a resident to the Office of Adult Protective Services, within the Department of Human Services, and the Service Facility Regulation Administration, within the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, within 24 hours of receipt of a complaint or information concerning suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation;"

D.C. Law 19-111, in subsec. (a)(1), substituted "Receive, investigate," for "Investigate"; and, in subsec. (a)(14), substituted "long-term care facility or home care agency" for "long-term care facility".

D.C. Law 19-171, in subsec. (a)(6), validated a previously made technical correction.
