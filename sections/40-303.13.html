Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-84 rewrote the section, which had read:

"Any person, entitled to a lien, as aforesaid, may commence his suit to enforce the same at any time within a year from and after the filing of the notice aforesaid or within 6 months from the completion of the building or repairs aforesaid, on his failure to do which the said lien shall cease to exist, unless his said claim be not due at the expiration of said periods, in which case the action must be commenced within 3 months after the said claim shall have become due."

D.C. Law 16-31 rewrote section, which had read as follows:

"(a) Any person, entitled to a lien, as aforesaid, may commence an action to enforce a mechanic's lien at anytime within 180 days after the filing of a notice of intention to hold a lien or from the date of completion of the building, improvement, or repairs. Upon failure to commence an action, the lien shall cease to exist; provided, that if the claim is not due at the expiration of the period, the action shall be commenced within 3 months after the claim shall have become due.

"(b) If an action to enforce a mechanic's lien is not filed within 180 days from the date of recording a notice of intention to hold a mechanic's lien, the mechanic's lien shall be deemed to have been paid and satisfied without any action on the part of the owner or any other person having an interest in the real property."
