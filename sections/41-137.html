                <dd> No agreement entered into after 7 months from the date of delivery of the property by the holder to the Mayor is valid if a person thereby undertakes to locate property included in a report for a fee or other compensation exceeding 10 percent of the value of the recoverable property unless the agreement is in writing and signed by the owner and discloses the nature and value of the property and the name and address of the holder of the property as such facts have been reported.
