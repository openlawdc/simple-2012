{"text":"For the purposes of this chapter, the term:","historical":"Effect of Amendments\n\nD.C. Law 18-55 rewrote par. (5), which had read as follows:\n\n\"(5) 'District gross receipts' means all income derived from any activity whatsoever from sources within the District, other than income of a feepayer derived from an ownership or beneficial interest in other feepayers subject to the ballpark fee, whether compensated in the District or not, prior to the deduction of any expense whatsoever connected with the production of the income, except that beginning with the ballpark fee that is required by this chapter to be paid in fiscal year 2005 and thereafter, the calculation of the income shall not include the collection of federal or local taxes on motor vehicle fuel.\"\n\nD.C. Law 18-341, in par. (6), designated the lead-in text as subpar. (A), redesignated former subpars. (A), (B), and (C) as sub-subpars. (i), (ii), and (iii), and added subpar. (B).\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nLaw 15-320, the \"Ballpark Omnibus Financing and Revenue Act of 2004\", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 15-1028, which was referred to the Committee of Finance and Revenue.

Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 18- 341, are not in effect.\n\nDC CODE § 47-2761\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Apr. 8, 2005, D.C.
