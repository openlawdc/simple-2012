Miscellaneous Notes

Section 2 of D.C. Law 17-156 amended this section subject to congressional enactment. As of the publication of this note, congress has not enacted section 2 of D.C. Law 17-156.

Section 401(a) of D.C. Law 19-124 provides for the addition of subsec. (e) to read as follows:

"(e)(1) By a 5/6 vote of its members, the Council may adopt a resolution of expulsion if it finds, based on substantial evidence, that a member of the Council took an action that amounts to a gross failure to meet the highest standards of personal and professional conduct. Expulsion is the most severe punitive action, serving as a penalty imposed for egregious wrongdoing. Expulsion results in the removal of the member. Expulsion should be used in cases in which the Council determines that the violation of law committed by a member is of the most serious nature, including those violations that substantially threaten the public trust. To protect the exercise of official member duties and the overriding principle of freedom of speech, the Council shall not impose expulsion on any member for the exercise of his or her First Amendment right, no matter how distasteful the expression of that right was to the Council and the District, or in the official exercise of his or her office.

"(2) The Council shall include in its Rules of Organization procedures for investigation, and consideration of, the expulsion of a member.".

Section 601(j) of D.C. Law 19-124 provides:

"(j) Title IV shall apply on its effective date as provided in section 303 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, approved December 24, 1973 (<a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=784'>87 Stat. 784</a>; D.C.

"Sec. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.

"The amendments made by section 2 shall apply with respect to vacancies occurring on or after the enactment of this Act."
