Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-38, in subsec.

D.C. Law 18-145 added subsec. (e).

D.C. Law 19-171, in subsec. (e), validated a previously made technical correction.

Editor's Notes

Because of the enactment of subchapter II of this chapter by D.C. Law 12-238 and the designation of the preexisting text as subchapter I, "subchapter" has been substituted for "act" twice near the end of (b).
