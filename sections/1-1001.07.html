Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-91 validated a previously made technical correction in par. (2) of subsec. (j).

D.C. Law 13-251 rewrote subsec. (e)(5)(A) which had read:

"(5)(A) Any duly registered voter may file with the Board objections to the registration of any person whom he or she has reason to believe is fictitious, deceased, a disqualified person, or otherwise ineligible to vote (except with respect to a change of residence), or file a request for the addition of any person whose name he or she has reason to believe has been erroneously omitted or cancelled from the voter roll. Application for the correction of the voter roll or the challenge of the right to vote of any person named on the voter roll shall be in writing and include any evidence in support of the challenge that the registrant is not qualified to be a registered voter. The challenge or application shall be filed with the Board not later than 90 days before the date of any election held under this subchapter."

D.C. Law 15-218 added subsec. (a-1), subpar. (K) of par. (c)(1), and par. (6) of subsec. (i); in par. (1) of subsec. (b), substituted "Help America Vote Act of 2002"' for "Federal Election Commission"; and, in par. (2) of subsec. (b), substituted "approved by the Board and shall meet the requirements of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, approved May 20, 1993 (107 Stat. 77; 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg et seq.) and the Help America Vote Act of 2002" for "approved by the Board" in the first sentence, and added the second sentence.

D.C. Law 17-236 added subsecs. (a-2), (b)(4); and, in subsec. (e)(2), inserted "The voter registration notification shall state that the applicant shall not vote before her or his 18th birthday."

D.C. Law 18-103 rewrote subsecs. (a-2), (b)(4), and (g); in subsec. (d)(1)(B), substituted "the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Youth and Rehabilitative Services, and the Office of Aging" for "the Senior Citizens Branch of the Department of Recreation and Parks and the Office of Aging"; and added subsec. (l). Prior to amendment, subsecs. (a-2), (b)(4), and (g) read as follows:

"(a-2) A person who is otherwise qualified may pre-register on or after that person's 17th birthday and may vote in any election occurring on or after that person's 18th birthday, but under no circumstances before the person's 18th birthday."

"(4) The Board shall state on voter registration forms that no one may vote before his or her 18th birthday."

"(g)(1) The registry shall be open during reasonable business hours, except that:

"(A) The registry shall not be open during the 30-day period that immediately precedes any primary, general, or District-wide special election.

"(B) The registry for a ward or Advisory Neighborhood Commission SMD shall not be open during the 30-day period that immediately precedes a special election for that ward or SMD.

"(2) The Board shall process mailed voter registration applications and registration, update notifications received postmarked by not later than the thirtieth day preceding any election and timely completed non-postmarked voter registration applications and registration update notifications mailed and received not later than the twenty-third day preceding any election. All other voter registration applications and update notifications received during the 30 days immediately preceding the date of any election shall be held and processed after the registry reopens.
