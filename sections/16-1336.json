Law 10-68, the \"Technical Amendments Act of 1993,\" was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 10-166, which was referred to the Committee of the Whole. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on June 29, 1993, and July 13, 1993, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on August 23, 1993, it was assigned Act No. 10-107 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 10-68 became effective on February 5, 1994.\n\nEditor's notes\n\nSection 4(l)(3)-(6) of D.C. Law 7-104 purported to substitute \"7-213\" for \"7- 214\" [1981 Ed.], and \"7-214\" for \"7-215\" [1981 Ed.] in subsection (a), \"7-322\" for \"7-323\" [1981 Ed.] in subsections (a) and (c), and \"7-301\" for \"7301\" [1981 Ed.] in subsection (c), apparently without regard to the amendment to this section by D.C. Law 4-201.\n\nThe reference in subsection (b) to \"sections referred to by subsection (a)\" has been rendered obsolete by amendments made in D.C. Law 4-201.\n\nDC CODE § 16-1336\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Dec. 23, 1963, 77 Stat. 576, Pub. L. 88-241, § 1; July 29, 1970, 84 Stat. 558, Pub.
