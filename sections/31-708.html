Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-191 rewrote this section which formerly provided:

"All information, documents, and copies obtained by or disclosed to the Mayor or any other person in the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant to § 35-3707 and all information reported pursuant to §§ 35-3705 and 35-3706 shall be given confidential treatment, shall not be subject to subpoena, and shall not be made public by the Mayor, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or any other person, except to insurance departments of other states, without the prior written consent of the insurer to which it pertains, unless the Mayor, after giving the insurer and its affiliates who would be affected notice and opportunity to be heard, determines that the interest of policyholders, shareholders, or the public will be served by publication, in which event the Mayor may publish all or any part in such a manner as he or she deems appropriate."

D.C. Law 15-166, in subsec. (a), substituted "Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking" for "Department of Insurance and Securities Regulation".
