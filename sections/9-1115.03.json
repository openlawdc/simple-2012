The United States District Courts shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the courts of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, of all actions brought by or against the Authority.

As used in this title, the following words shall have the following meanings:\n\n\n\n\nArticle II\n\nBonds Not to Constitute a Debt or Pledge of Taxing Power\n\n26. Revenue bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation issued under the provisions of this subchapter shall not be deemed to constitute a debt or a pledge of the faith and credit of the Authority or of any signatory government or political subdivision thereof, but such bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided therefor from tolls and other revenues. The issuance of revenue bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation, under the provisions of this subchapter, shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the Authority, or any signatory government or political subdivision thereof, to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor. All such revenue bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation shall contain a statement on their face substantially to the foregoing effect.\n\nArticle III\n\nAdditional Powers of the Authority\n\n27. Without in any manner limiting or restricting the powers heretofore given to the Authority, the Authority is hereby authorized and empowered:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle IV\n\nAcquisition of Property\n\n28. The Authority is hereby authorized and empowered to acquire by purchase, whenever it shall deem such purchase expedient, solely from funds provided under the authority of this Compact, such lands, structures, rights-of-way, property, rights, franchises, easements, and other interest in lands, including lands lying under water and riparian rights, which are located within the jurisdictions of the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, as described in Article I of Title I of this Compact, as it may deem necessary or convenient for the construction and operation of the project, upon such terms and at such prices as may be considered by it to be reasonable and can be agreed upon between it and the owner thereof; and to take title thereto in the name of the Authority.\n\n29. All counties, cities, towns, and other political subdivisions and all public agencies and authorities of the signatories, notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, are hereby authorized and empowered to lease, lend, grant, or convey to the Authority at the Authority's request, upon such terms and conditions as the proper authorities of such counties, cities, towns, political subdivisions, agencies, or authorities may deem reasonable and fair and without the necessity for any advertisement, order of court or other action or formality, other than the regular and formal action of the authorities concerned, any real property which may be necessary or convenient to the effectuation of the authorized purposes of the Authority, including public roads and other real property already devoted to public use.\n\n30. Whenever a reasonable price cannot be agreed upon, or whenever the owner is legally incapacitated or is absent, unknown, or unable to convey valid title, the Authority is hereby authorized and empowered to acquire by condemnation or by the exercise of the power of eminent domain any lands, property, rights, rights-of-way, franchises, easements, and other property deemed necessary or convenient for the construction or the efficient operation of the project or necessary in the restoration of public or private property damaged or destroyed.\n\n31. Whenever the Authority acquires property under Article IV of this Title, it shall comply with the applicable federal law relating to relocation and relocation assistance. If there is no applicable federal law, the Authority shall comply with the applicable provision of state or District of Columbia law in which the property is located.\n\nProcurement\n\n32. Except as provided in sections 33, 34, and 37, and except in the case of procurement procedures otherwise expressly authorized by federal statute, the Authority, in conducting a procurement of property, services, and construction, shall:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33. The Authority may provide for the procurement of property, services, or construction covered by this article using competitive procedures but excluding a particular source in order to establish or maintain an alternative source or sources of supply for that property, service, or construction if the Authority determines that excluding the source would increase or maintain competition and would likely result in reduced overall costs for procurement of property, services, and construction.\n\n34. The Authority may use procedures other than competitive procedures if:\n\n\n\n\n\n35. For the purposes of applying section 34(a):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36. If the Authority uses procedures other than the competitive procedures to procure property, services, or construction under section 34(b), the Authority shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.\n\n37. (a) To promote efficiency and economy in contracting, the Authority may use simplified acquisition procedures for purchases of property, services, or construction.\n\n\n\n\n38. The Board shall adopt policies and procedures to implement sections 32-37 of this Article. The policies and procedures shall provide for publication of notice of procurements and other actions designed to secure competition where competitive procedures are used.\n\n39. The Authority, in its discretion, may reject any and all bids or proposals received in response to a solicitation.\n\nArticle V\n\nIncidental Powers\n\n40. The Authority shall have power to construct grade separations at intersections of the project with public highways and to change and adjust the lines and grades of such highways so as to accommodate the same to the design of such grade separation. The cost of such grade separations, and any damage incurred in changing and adjusting the lines and grades of such highways, shall be ascertained and paid by the Authority as a part of the cost of the project. If the Authority shall find it necessary to change the location of any portion of any public highway, it shall cause the same to be reconstructed at such location as the Authority shall deem most favorable and of substantially the same type and in as good condition as the original highway. The cost of such reconstruction and any damage incurred in changing the location of any such highway shall be ascertained and paid by the Authority as a part of the cost of the project.\n\n41. Subject to the approval by the highest ranking official of the jurisdiction in which the work is to take place, as the case may be, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, Governor of Maryland, or Governor of Virginia, any public highway affected by the construction of the project may be vacated or relocated by the Authority in the manner now provided by law for the vacation or relocation of public roads, and any damages awarded on account thereof shall be paid by the Authority as a part of the cost of the project.\n\n42. In addition to the foregoing powers, the Authority and its authorized agents and employees may enter upon any lands, waters, and premises in the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, and State of Maryland for the purpose of making surveys, soundings, drillings, and examinations as they may deem necessary or convenient for the purposes of this Compact, and such entry shall not be deemed a trespass, nor shall an entry for such purposes be deemed an entry under any condemnation proceedings which may be then pending. The Authority shall make reimbursement for any actual damage resulting to such lands, waters, and premises as a result of such activities.\n\n43. The Authority shall also have power to make reasonable regulations for the installation, construction, maintenance, repair, renewal, relocation, and removal of tracks, pipes, mains, conduits, cables, wires, towers, poles, and other equipment and appliances (herein called \"public utility facilities\") of any public utility in, on, along, over, or under the project. Whenever the Authority shall determine that it is necessary that any such public utility facilities which now are, or hereafter may be, located in, on, along, over, or under the project should be relocated in the project, or should be removed from the project, the public utility owning or operating such facilities shall relocate or remove the same in accordance with the order of the Authority, provided that the cost and expenses of such relocation or removal, including the cost of installing such facilities in a new location or new locations, and the cost of any lands, or any rights or interests in lands, and any other rights, acquired to accomplish such relocation or removal, shall be ascertained and paid by the Authority as a part of the cost of the project. In case of any such relocation or removal of facilities, the public utility owning or operating the same, its successors or assigns, may maintain and operate such facilities, with the necessary appurtenances, in the new location or new locations, for as long a period, and upon the same terms and conditions, as it had the right to maintain and operate such facilities in their former location or locations.\n\n44. The Authority may use all lands owned by the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, and State of Maryland, including lands lying under water, which are necessary for the construction or operation of the project subject to approval of the highest-ranking official of the affected jurisdiction.\n\nArticle VI\n\nRevenue Bonds\n\n45. The Authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution, at one time or from time to time, for the issuance of revenue bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation of the Authority to pay all or a part of the cost of all or a part of the project.\n\nArticle VII\n\nTrust Indenture\n\n46. In the discretion of the Authority, any bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation issued under the provisions of this Compact may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, or State of Maryland. Such trust indenture or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the tolls and other revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage the project or any part thereof.\n\nArticle VIII\n\nRevenues\n\n47. The Authority is hereby authorized to fix, revise, charge, and collect tolls for the use of the project, and to contract with any person, partnership, association, or corporation desiring the use thereof, and to fix the terms, conditions, rents, and rates of charges for such use.\n\n48. Such tolls shall be so fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of tolls from the project as to provide a fund sufficient with other revenues, if any, to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating such project, and the principal of, and the interest on, such bonds as the same shall become due and payable, and to create reserves for such purposes. Such tolls shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any other authority, board, bureau, or agency of the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, or State of Maryland. The tolls and all other revenues derived from the project in connection with which the bonds of any issue shall have been issued, except such part thereof as may be necessary to pay such cost of maintenance, repair, and operation and to provide such reserves therefor as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust indenture securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or such trust indenture in a sinking fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of, and the interest on, such bonds as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The tolls, other revenues, or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the Authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the Authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust indenture by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the Authority. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust indenture. Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or such trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for all such bonds without distinction or priority of one over another.\n\nArticle IX\n\nTrust Funds\n\n49. All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Compact, whether as proceeds from the sale of bonds or as revenues, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this Compact. The resolution authorizing the bonds of any issue or the trust indenture securing such bonds shall provide that any officer with whom, or any bank or trust company with which, such moneys shall be deposited shall act as trustee of such moneys and shall hold and apply the same for the purposes thereof, subject to such regulations as this Compact and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.\n\nArticle X\n\nRemedies\n\n50. Any holder of bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation issued under the provisions of this Compact or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under any trust indenture, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by such trust indenture or the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceeding, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, and State of Maryland, or granted hereunder or under such trust indenture or the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this Compact or by such trust indenture or resolution to be performed by the Authority or by any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of tolls.\n\nArticle XI\n\nTax Exemption\n\n51. The exercise of the powers granted by this Compact will be in all respects for the benefit of the people of the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, and State of Maryland and for the increase of their commerce and prosperity, and as the operation and maintenance of the project will constitute the performance of essential governmental functions, the Authority shall not be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon the project or any property acquired or used by the Authority under the provisions of this Compact or upon the income therefrom, and the bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation issued under the provisions of this Compact, their transfer and the income therefrom, including any profit made on the sale thereof, shall at all times be free from taxation within the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, and State of Maryland.\n\nArticle XII\n\nBonds Eligible for Investment\n\n52. Bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation issued by the Authority under the provisions of this Compact are hereby made securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, and State of Maryland and their political subdivisions, all insurance companies, trust companies, banking associations, investment companies, executors, administrators, trustees, and other fiduciaries may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. Such bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation are hereby made securities which may properly and legally be deposited with, and received by, any District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, and State of Maryland municipal officer or any agency or political subdivision thereof for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.\n\nArticle XIII\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n53. Any action taken by the Authority under the provisions of this Compact may be authorized by resolution at any regular or special meeting, and each such resolution shall take effect immediately and need not be published or posted.\n\n54. The project when constructed and opened to traffic shall be maintained and kept in good condition and repair by the Authority. The project shall also be policed and operated by such force of police, toll-takers, and other operating employees as the Authority may in its discretion employ. The Authority shall comply with all laws, ordinances, and regulations of the signatories and political subdivisions and agencies thereof with respect to the use of streets, highways, and all other vehicular facilities, traffic control and regulation, signs, and buildings.\n\n55. An Authority police officer shall have all the powers granted to a peace officer and police officer of the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, and the State of Maryland. However, an Authority police officer may exercise these powers only on property owned, leased, operated by, or under control of the Authority, and may not exercise these powers on any other property unless:\n\n\n\n\n56. All other police officers of the signatory parties and of each county, city, town, or other political subdivision of the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, and State of Maryland through which the project, or portion thereof, extends shall have the same powers and jurisdiction within the limits of such projects as they have beyond such limits and shall have access to the project at any time for the purpose of exercising such powers and jurisdiction.\n\n57. On or before the last day of September in each year, the Authority shall make an annual report of its activities for the preceding calendar year to the Governors of Maryland and Virginia and the Mayor of the District of Columbia. Each such report shall set forth a complete operating and financial statement covering its operations during the year.  The Authority shall cause an audit of its books and accounts to be made at least once in each year by certified public accountants and the cost thereof may be treated as a part of the cost of construction or operation of the project.   The records, books, and accounts of the Authority shall be subject to examination and inspection by duly authorized representatives of the governing bodies of Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, and by any bondholder or bondholders at any reasonable time, provided the business of the Authority is not unduly interrupted or interfered with thereby.\n\n58. Any member, agent, or employee of the Authority who contracts with the Authority or is interested, either directly or indirectly, in any contract with the Authority or in the sale of any property, either real or personal, to the Authority shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both.\n\n59. Any person who uses the project and fails or refuses to pay the toll provided therefor shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $100 or by imprisonment for not more than 30 days, or both, and in addition thereto the Authority shall have a lien upon the vehicle driven by such person for the amount of such toll and may take and retain possession thereof until the amount of such toll and all charges in connection therewith shall have been paid.\n\n60. When one signatory adopts an amendment or supplement to an existing section of the Compact, that amendment or supplement shall not be immediately effective, and the previously enacted provision or provisions shall remain in effect in each jurisdiction until the amendment or supplement is approved by the other signatories and is consented to by Congress.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., § 1-2483.\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nFor legislative history of D.C.
