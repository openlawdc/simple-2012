"(a) Notwithstanding any statutory provision or rule of law to the contrary, in the winding-up of a captive insurer, the liquidator:

"(1) Shall deal with the company's assets only in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection (c)(6) of this section; and

"(2) In the discharge of the claims of creditors of the captive insurer, shall apply the captive insurer's assets to those entitled to have recourse thereto under the provisions of § 31-3931.04.

"(c)(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the court may make     a liquidation or rehabilitation order with respect to a segregated account if, in relation to a captive insurer, the court is satisfied that the:

"(A) Segregated account assets attributable to a particular segregated account of the captive insurer, and in those cases where creditors of the captive insurer with respect to that segregated account are entitled to have recourse to the captive insurer's general assets, are or are likely to be insufficient to discharge the claims of creditors with respect to that segregated account; and

"(B) Making of an order under this section would achieve the purposes set forth in paragraph (3) of this subsection.

"(2) A liquidation or rehabilitation order may be made with respect to one or more segregated accounts.

"(3) A liquidation or rehabilitation order shall direct that the business and segregated account assets of, or attributable to, a segregated account shall be managed by a liquidator or rehabilitator specified in the order for the purpose of:

"(3) In exercising his functions and powers, shall be deemed to act as the agent of the captive insurer and shall not incur personal liability except to the extent that he acts fraudulently, recklessly, negligently, or in bad faith.

"(e) Upon the filing of a petition for, and during the period of operation of, a liquidation or rehabilitation order:

"(f)(1) During the period of operation of a liquidation or rehabilitation order:

"(A) The functions and powers of the directors shall cease with respect to the business of, or attributable to, the segregated account or segregated account assets for which the order was made; and

"(B) The liquidator or rehabilitator of the segregated account shall be entitled to be present at all meetings of the captive insurer or segregated account and to vote at such meetings as if he or she were a director of the captive insurer.

"(2) Unless there are no creditors that are entitled to have recourse to the captive insurer's general assets, the liquidator's or rehabilitator's voting authority includes matters concerning the captive insurer's general assets.

"(g)(1) The Court shall not discharge a liquidation or rehabilitation order issued pursuant to this section unless it appears to the Court that the purpose for which the order was made has been achieved, substantially achieved, or is incapable of being achieved.

"(2) The Court, on hearing a petition for the discharge or variation of a liquidation or rehabilitation order, may make any interim order or adjourn the proceeding.

"(3) Upon the Court issuing an order discharging a liquidation or rehabilitation order for a segregated account on the ground that the purpose for which the order was made had been achieved or substantially achieved, the Court may direct that any payment made by the liquidator or rehabilitator to any creditor of the captive insurer, with respect to that segregated account, shall be full satisfaction of the liabilities of the captive insurer to that creditor with respect to that segregated account, and the creditor's claims against the captive insurer with respect to that segregated account shall be thereby extinguished."
