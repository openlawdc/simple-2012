Miscellaneous Notes

The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of February 15, 2012, that the fiscal effect of Law 18-337 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan as required by subsection (b) of this section. That determination, however, does not affect the codification of this section.
