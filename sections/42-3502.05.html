1981 Ed., § 45-2515.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-145, in subpar. (a)(7)(C), substituted "rent charged" for "rent ceiling"; and rewrote subsec. (g), which had read as follows:

"(g) An amended registration statement shall be filed by each housing provider whose rental units are subject to registration under this chapter within 30 days of any event which changes or substantially affects the rents including vacant unit rent increases under <a href='./42-3502.13.html'>§ 42-3502.13</a>, services, facilities, or the housing provider or management of any rental unit in a registered housing accommodation. No amended registration statement shall be required for a change in rent under <a href='./42-3502.06.html'>§ 42-3502.06(b)</a>."

D.C. Law 17-219, in subsec. (g)(2), substituted "The" for "Subject to appropriation, the".

D.C. Law 17-353 validated a previously made technical correction in subsec. (a)(7)(C).
