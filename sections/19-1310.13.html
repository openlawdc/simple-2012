                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> A certification of trust must state that the trust has not been revoked, modified, or amended in any manner that would cause the representations contained in the certification of trust to be incorrect.</dd>

                <dd> A certification of trust need not contain the dispositive terms of a trust.</dd>

                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd> A person who acts in reliance upon a certification of trust without knowledge that the representations contained therein are incorrect is not liable to any person for so acting and may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the certification. Knowledge of the terms of the trust may not be inferred solely from the fact that a copy of all or part of the trust instrument is held by the person relying upon the certification.</dd>
            
                <dt>g</dt>
                <dd> A person who in good faith enters into a transaction in reliance upon a certification of trust may enforce the transaction against the trust property as if the representations contained in the certification were correct.</dd>

                <dd> This section does not limit the right of a person to obtain a copy of the trust instrument in a judicial proceeding concerning the trust.</dd>
