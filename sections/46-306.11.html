1981 Ed., § 30-346.11.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-137, rewrote section, which had read as follows:

"(a) After a child support order issued in another state has been registered in the District, the responding tribunal of the District may modify that order only if <a href='./46-306.13.html'>§ 46-306.13</a> does not apply and after notice and hearing it finds that:

"(1) The following requirements are met:

"(A) The child, the individual obligee, and the obligor do not reside in the issuing state;

"(B) A petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification; and

"(C) The respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of the District; or

"(2) The child, or a party who is an individual, is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of the District and all of the parties who are individuals have filed written consents in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of the District to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order. However, if the issuing state is a foreign jurisdiction that has not enacted a law or established procedures substantially similar to the procedures under this chapter, the consent otherwise required of an individual residing in the District is not required for the tribunal to assume jurisdiction to modify the child support order.

"(b) Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of the District and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.

"(c) A tribunal of the District may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state.   If 2 or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and child, the order that controls establishes the aspects of the support order which are nonmodifiable, and must be so recognized under <a href='./46-302.07.html'>§ 46-302.07</a>.

"(d) On issuance of an order modifying a child support order issued in another state, a tribunal of the District becomes the tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction."
