Miscellaneous Notes

Sick Leave Buyout for Department of Corrections Employees: Section 8 of Pub. L. 105-274, 112 Stat. 2428, the District of Columbia Courts and Justice Technical Corrections Act of 1998, provides that notwithstanding any provision of District of Columbia law, the Corrections Trustee appointed pursuant to section 11202 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 may set conditions and may provide that an employee of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections who meets such conditions will receive a lump-sum payment for his or her accumulated and accrued sick leave, if the employee is separated involuntarily and is not subsequently employed, without a break in service of more than 3 days, by the Bureau of Prisons or another Federal agency. The lump sum payment for sick leave shall be calculated by multiplying 50 percent of the employee's rate of basic pay, exclusive of additional payments of any kind, by the number of hours of accumulated sick leave to the employee's credit at the time of separation. The lump-sum payment shall be considered pay for taxation purposes only and shall not be used to confer any other benefit to the employee.
