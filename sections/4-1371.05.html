        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-341 rewrote subsec. (a) which had read as follows:

"(a) The Committee shall be responsible for reviewing the deaths of children who were residents of the District of Columbia and of such children who, or whose families, at the time of death, or at any point during the 2 years prior to the child's death, were known to the child welfare, juvenile justice, or mental retardation or developmental disabilities systems of the District of Columbia."

D.C. Law 19-169, in subsec. (a)(1), substituted "intellectual disability" for "mental retardation"; and, in subsec. (e)(2), substituted "intellectual or developmental disabilities systems" for "mental retardation/developmental disabilities system".
