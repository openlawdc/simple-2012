        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-217, rewrote subsec. (f); and repealed subsec. (g). Prior to amendment, subsecs. (f) and (g) had read as follows:

"(f)(1) Except as provided by paragraph (3) of this subsection, before a final assessment of a penalty against a person under this section, the Mayor shall send the person a proposed assessment and provide the person, not less than 30 days after the proposed assessment is sent, with an opportunity to file a protest that explains why the penalty should not be assessed. If a protest is filed in a timely manner, the Mayor shall grant the person a hearing.

"(2) If the person fails to file a protest in a timely manner under paragraph (1) of this subsection, or the Mayor determines after a hearing granted under paragraph (1) of this subsection that the person is subject to a penalty under this section, the Mayor shall send the person a final assessment of the penalty.

"(3) If the period of limitations will expire without adequate opportunity for assessment, the Mayor may issue a final assessment of a penalty against a person under this chapter without first issuing a proposed assessment.

"(4) The penalty shall be paid within 30 days after the final assessment is sent to the person.

"(g)(1) A claim for refund of a penalty paid under this section may be filed with the Mayor by the person against whom the penalty is assessed. The claim for refund shall be in a form prescribed by the Mayor and shall state the specific grounds upon which the claim for refund is based.

"(2) If the Mayor denies the claim for refund, the person may, within 6 months from the date of the denial, appeal to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in §<a href='./47-3303.html'>§ 47-3303</a>, 47-3304, and 47-3306 through 47-3308."
