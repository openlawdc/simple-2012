Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-289 validated a previously made change and rewrote subsec. (d), which had read:

"(d) A person to whom a notice of infraction has been issued shall answer within 15 calendar days of the date the notice was issued. Failure to answer within the prescribed period may result in imposition of monetary penalties established by <a href='./50-2301.05.html'>§ 50-2301.05</a>, in addition to the potential civil fine for the infraction. This subsection shall not apply to any fleet owner who participates in the fleet adjudication program."

D.C. Law 16-279, in subsec. (a), par. (2), added subpars. (F), and (G); in subsec. (b), substituted "telephone, email, or through the Department's website" for "telephone"; in subsec. (d), par. (2), substituted "mail, to the address in the Department of Motor Vehicles' records, if such address was supplied to the Department of Motor Vehicles," for "mail"; and added subsec. (f).

D.C. Law 17-303, in subsec. (a)(1)(A), substituted "civil fine and any related vehicle conveyance fee" for "civil fine"; in subsec. (c), substituted "civil fine, any related vehicle conveyance fee assessed by the District," for "civil fine"; in subsec. (d)(1), inserted "and any related vehicle conveyance fee"; and, in subsec. (d)(2), substituted "penalties, fines, and any vehicle conveyance fees" for "penalties and fines".
