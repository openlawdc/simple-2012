References in Text

The phrase "the effective date of this subsection," referred to in the first sentence of (d), is prescribed by ยง 201(b) of <a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%2092-410'>Pub. L. 92-410</a>, effective August 29, 1972, which states, that in part, "The amendments made by paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection [(a)] shall be effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after the date of enactment of this title.".

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, ยง 711 (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.11.html'>ยง 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to ยง 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.14.html'>ยง 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.
