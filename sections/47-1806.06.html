                <dd> When a claimant rents 2 or more different homes in the District in the same calendar year, rent paid by the claimant during that year shall be determined by dividing the rent paid pursuant to the last rental agreement in force during that calendar year by the number of months during that calendar year for which this rent was paid and by multiplying the result by 12.</dd>
            
                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd> The right to file under this section shall be personal to the claimant, but such right may be exercised by his legal guardian or attorney-in-fact. The right to file a claim shall not survive the death of a claimant.

                <dd> Subject to the limitations provided in this section, commencing with the taxable year beginning after December 31, 1974, and for succeeding taxable years, the claimant may claim as a credit against the District income taxes otherwise due on his income, property taxes accrued or rent constituting property taxes accrued for that year. If the allowable amount of such claim exceeds the income taxes otherwise due from the claimant, or other tax liabilities of the claimant to the District, or if there are no District income taxes due from the claimant, the amount of the claim not used as an offset against income taxes or other tax liabilities of the claimant to the District shall be paid or credited to the claimant. No interest shall be allowed on any payment made to a claimant pursuant to this section.</dd>
            
                <dt>h</dt>
                <dd> No claim with respect to property taxes accrued or with respect to rent constituting property taxes accrued shall be allowed unless a District of Columbia individual income tax return or (if the claimant is not required to file such return) a claim for credit under this section is filed with the District on the forms and in such manner and with such information as the Mayor may prescribe. Any claim for credit shall be filed with the District on or before the expiration of the 3-year statute of limitations. The statute of limitations shall commence to run on April 15th of the year following the year for which the claim is made.</dd>
            
                <dt>i</dt>
                <dd> The amount of any claim otherwise payable under this section may be applied by the District against any outstanding tax liability of the claimant to the District.</dd>
            
                <dt>j</dt>
                <dd>(1) In determining eligibility for the credit allowable under this section, and for the purpose of determining outstanding tax liability (if any) of the claimant to the District household income for which the claim is filed and the claimant's outstanding tax liability (if any) shall be determined on the basis of the combined household income of all members present in the household.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> In the case of spouses or domestic partners who, during the entire calendar year for which a claim is filed under this section, maintain separate homes, for the purpose of determining household income and the claimant's outstanding tax liability (if any), such spouses or domestic partners shall be deemed to have been unmarried during the calendar year for which the claim is made.</dd>
            
                <dt>k</dt>
                <dd> No credit shall be allowed under this subchapter for any year during which the person claiming the credit was a dependent, under any state, federal, or District law levying a tax on income, unless during that year such person is or becomes 65 years of age or older.</dd>
            
                <dt>l</dt>
                <dd> A claimant whose claim is based on the amount of rent paid shall substantiate the rent paid upon a request by the Mayor.</dd>
            
                <dt>m</dt>
                <dd>(1) If, on an audit of any claim filed under this section, the Mayor finds the amount to have been incorrectly computed, he shall determine the correct amount and notify the claimant in accordance with the procedures set forth in <a href='./47-1812.05.html'>§ 47-1812.05</a>.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> If it is determined that a claim was filed with fraudulent intent, it shall be disallowed in full. If the claim has been paid or a credit has been allowed against income taxes otherwise payable, the credit shall be canceled and the amount paid shall be assessed against the claimant and recovered in the same manner as provided for the collection of taxes under <a href='./47-412.html'>§ 47-412</a>.</dd>
            
                <dt>n</dt>
                <dd> No claim for relief under this section shall be allowed to any person who was not living in a home which was subject to District of Columbia real property taxation during the calendar year for which the claim is filed.</dd>
            
                <dt>o</dt>
                <dd> The Mayor is authorized to provide a table which will approximate, as closely as feasible, the amount of relief allowable under this section.</dd>
            
                <dt>p</dt>
                <dd> If it is determined by the District that a claimant received title to his home in the District or became legally obligated to pay rent for his home in the District primarily for the purpose of receiving benefits under the provisions of this section, his claim shall be disallowed.</dd>
