The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on November 29, 1988 and December 13, 1988, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on January 6, 1989, it was assigned Act No. 7-285 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review.\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nTransfer of Functions\n\n\"National Capital Planning Commission\" was substituted for \"National Capital Park and Planning Commission\" in the introductory language in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section and in subparagraph (A) of that paragraph in view of the Act of June 6, 1924, ch. 270, § 9, as added by the Act of July 19, 1952, 66 Stat. 790, ch. 949, § 1, which transferred the functions, powers, and duties of the National Capital Park and Planning Commission to the National Capital Planning Commission.\n\nThe functions of the National Capital Housing Authority were transferred to the Department of Public and Assisted Housing by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1987, effective December 15, 1987.\n\nDelegation of Authority\n\nDelegation of Authority to Implement the Provisions of the District of Columbia Alley Dwelling Act, see Mayor's Order 88-30, December 15, 1987; Mayor's Order 88-161, December 15, 1987.\n\nDC CODE § 6-101.02\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(June 12, 1934, 48 Stat. 931, ch. 465, § 2; July 29, 1970, 84 Stat. 587, Pub.
