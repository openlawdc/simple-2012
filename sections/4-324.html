                <dd> The submission of any claim for payment or reimbursement for services or benefits pursuant to this section or the making of any statement in connection therewith, which claim or statement the maker knows or should know to be false, misleading or fraudulent shall be punishable as perjury and shall also be subject to a fine not to exceed $10,000 or imprisonment for not to exceed 30 days, or both. A violation of this subsection shall be prosecuted by the Corporation Counsel of the District of Columbia.</dd>
