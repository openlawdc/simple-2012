Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.

Transfer of Functions

Organization Order No. 104 provided for the establishment, maintenance, and administration of a register of blind persons by the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation. All functions stated in such Order were transferred to the Director of the Department of Human Resources by Commissioner's Order No. 69- 96, dated March 7, 1969, as amended by Commissioner's Order No. 70-83, dated March 6, 1970. The Department of Human Resources was replaced by the Department of Human Services, by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1979, dated February 21, 1980.
