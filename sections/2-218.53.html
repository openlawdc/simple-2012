        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-207, in subsec. (a)(1)(D), substituted "certified" for "local, small, or disadvantaged"; and, in subsecs. (a)(2)(A), (3)(A), (b)(2)(A), substituted "Certified" for "Local, small, or disadvantaged".

D.C. Law 18-111 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:

"(a) Each agency shall submit to the Department, within 30 days after the end of the quarter, a quarterly report listing each expenditure as it appears in the general ledger from the expendable budget of the agency during the quarter, which shall include:

"(1) The name of the vendor from which the goods or services were purchased;

"(2) The vendor identification number as it appears in the general ledger;

"(3) A description of the goods or services;

"(4) Whether the vendor was a certified Small Business Enterprise;

"(5) The funding source for the expenditure (local, federal, other, or capital);

"(6) The date of the expenditure;

"(7) The dollar amount of the expenditure; and

"(8) The total expenditure on Small Business Enterprises and the percentage that the total expenditure on Small Business Enterprises is when compared to the total expenditure.

"(b) Each agency shall submit to the Department, within 30 days of the issuance of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, an annual report listing each expenditure as it appears in the general ledger from the expendable budget of the agency during the fiscal year which shall include:

"(1) The information required to be included in the quarterly reports (with calculations for the fiscal year);

"(2) A description of the activities the agency engaged in, including the programs required by this part, to achieve the goals set forth in <a href='./2-218.41.html'>§ 2-218.41</a>; and

"(3) A description of any changes the agency intends to make during the succeeding fiscal year to the activities it engages in to achieve the goals set forth in <a href='./2-218.41.html'>§ 2-218.41</a>.

"(c) The Department shall monitor agency compliance with the reporting requirements of this section.

"(d) The District of Columbia Auditor shall review the annual report of each agency to determine whether the planned activities of the agency for the succeeding fiscal year are likely to enable the agency to achieve the goals set forth in <a href='./2-218.41.html'>§ 2-218.41</a>. The District of Columbia Auditor shall make recommendations on activities the agency should engage in to meet or exceed the goals set forth in <a href='./2-218.41.html'>§ 2-218.41</a>. The District of Columbia Auditor's recommendations shall be submitted to the agency, the Council, and the Department.

"(e) The Department may review the annual report of an agency to determine whether the planned activities of the agency for the succeeding fiscal year are likely to enable the agency to achieve the goals set forth in <a href='./2-218.41.html'>§ 2-218.41</a>. The Department may make recommendations on activities the agency should engage in to meet or exceed the goals set forth in <a href='./2-218.41.html'>§ 2-218.41</a>. The Department's recommendations, if any, shall be submitted to the agency and the Council."

D.C. Law 18-141 rewrote subsecs. (a) and (e); and, in subsec. (b), substituted "the Department and the District of Columbia Auditor" for "the Department". Prior to amendment, subsecs. (a) and (e) read as follows:

"(a) Each agency shall submit to the Department, within 30 days after the end of the quarter, a quarterly report listing each expenditure as it appears in the general ledger from the expendable budget of the agency during the quarter, which shall include:

"(1) The name of the vendor from which the goods or services were purchased;

"(2) The vendor identification number as it appears in the general ledger;

"(3) A description of the goods or services;

"(4) Whether the vendor was a certified Small Business Enterprise;

"(5) The funding source for the expenditure (local, federal, other, or capital);

"(6) The date of the expenditure;

"(7) The dollar amount of the expenditure; and

"(8) The total expenditure on Small Business Enterprises and the percentage that the total expenditure on Small Business Enterprises is when compared to the total expenditure."

"(e) The Department may review the annual report of an agency to determine whether the planned activities of the agency for the succeeding fiscal year are likely to enable the agency to achieve the goals set forth in <a href='./2-218.41.html'>§ 2-218.41</a>. The Department may make recommendations on activities the agency should engage in to meet or exceed the goals set forth in <a href='./2-218.41.html'>§ 2-218.41</a>. The Department's recommendations, if any, shall be submitted to the agency and the Council."

D.C. Law 18-159, in the lead-in language of subsec. (a), inserted "The 4th quarter and annual report shall be submitted together."; and rewrote subsec. (a)(8), which had read as follows:

"(8) The total expenditure on certified small business enterprises and the percentage the total expenditure on certified small business enterprises is of the total expenditure."
