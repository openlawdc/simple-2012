Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-166, rewrote subsec. (b)(3), which previously read:

"(A) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph a grocery store that is a supermarket development as that term is defined in <a href='./47-3801.html'>§ 47-3801(3)</a> in an underserved area of the District approved pursuant to <a href='./47-3803.html'>§ 47-3803</a>, shall be exempt from the license fee imposed by this subsection for the first 5 years beginning after the date of issuance of the final certificate of occupancy for the supermarket.

"(B) The license fee exemption granted by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall apply:

"(i) Only during the time that the real property is used as a supermarket;

"(ii) In the case of a supermarket development on real property not owned by the supermarket, only if the owner of the real property leases the land or structure to the supermarket at a rent reduced from the fair market rent by an amount equal to the amount of the real property tax exemption provided by <a href='./47-1002.html'>§ 47- 1002(23)</a>;

"(iii) Only during the time that the supermarket development is in compliance with the requirements of <a href='./1-1161.html'>§ 1-1161</a> et seq.; and
