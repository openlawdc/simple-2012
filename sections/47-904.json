In any such case, the return required to be filed with the deed shall contain such information as to the fair market value of the real property as the Mayor shall require. Whenever, in the opinion of the Mayor, a return does not contain sufficient information as to the fair market value of such real property, the Mayor is authorized to make a determination thereof from the best information available.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., § 47-904.\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nFor legislative history of D.C.
