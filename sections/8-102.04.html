        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 19-21, in subsec. (b)(2)(A), substituted "warning" for "warning in a calendar year"; and, in subsecs. (b)(2)(B) and (C), substituted "violation" for "violation in the same calendar year".

D.C. Law 19-188 rewrote subsec. (b), which had read as follows:

"(b) If the Mayor determines that a violation has occurred, the retail establishment shall be liable for the fees under <a href='./8-102.03.html'>§ 8-102.03(a)</a> and:

"(1) Upon the 1st violation, written warning notice that a violation has occurred shall be issued to the retail establishment. No penalty shall be imposed for the 1st violation.

"(2) Upon subsequent violations, the Mayor shall impose a penalty on the retail establishment. The penalty shall not exceed:

"(A) $100 for the 1st violation after the written warning;

"(B) $200 for the 2nd violation; or

"(C) $500 for the 3rd and each subsequent violation.

"(3) No more than one penalty shall be imposed upon a retail establishment within a 7-day period."
