Such notice may be served by its delivery personally to the accused licensee by the United States Marshal in the manner prescribed for service of original process in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, or by mailing it by registered mail or by certified mail with return receipt demanded, to the place of business last theretofore specified by the accused in his last notification to the Board. At the time and place fixed in the notice, the Board shall proceed to hearing of the charges and both the accused and the complainant shall be accorded ample opportunity to present, in person or by counsel, such testimony, evidence, and argument as may be pertinent to the charges or to any defense thereto. The Board may continue such hearing from time to time and shall give notice in writing to all parties in interest of the date and hour to which the hearing has been continued, and the place at which it is to be held.</dd>

The notice of hearing, complaint, and all other documents in the nature of pleadings and written motions filed in the proceedings, the transcript of testimony, and the orders of the Board shall be the record of such proceedings. The Board shall furnish a transcript of such record at cost to any person interested in such hearing.</dd>
