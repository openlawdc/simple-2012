                <dd> If the Commissioner petitions the Superior Court to appoint a receiver for a universal bank, the Commissioner shall request that the Superior Court appoint the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as the receiver if any of the deposits in the universal bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</dd>

                <dd> The Superior Court may act upon a petition by the Commissioner for the appointment of a receiver immediately and without notice to any person. The Superior Court may appoint a receiver if the Superior Court determines that a condition set forth in subsection (a) of this section exists and that the bank is operating, or may operate, in an unsafe or unsound manner. The Superior Court may also issue an injunction to require a universal bank to correct any condition set forth in subsection (a) of this section, notwithstanding whether the bank is operating, or may operate, in an unsafe or unsound manner. If the Superior Court appoints a receiver and, after the appointment of a receiver, it appears to the Superior Court that reasons for receivership do not, or no longer, exist, the Superior Court shall dissolve the receivership and terminate any pending proceedings.</dd>

                <dd> If a universal bank has been closed and placed in receivership, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation pays, or makes available for payment, the insured deposit liabilities of the closed bank, the rights of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, whether or not the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is the receiver of the bank, shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the owners of the deposits against the closed universal bank in the same manner and to the same extent as subrogation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is provided for in section 11(g) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, approved September 21, 1950 (64 Stat. 884; 12 U.S.C. § 1821(g)).</dd>
