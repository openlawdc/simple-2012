1981 Ed., § 1-624.44.

1973 Ed., § 1-353.44.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-28 deleted the second sentence which had read: " The rules and regulations shall provide for an Employees' Compensation Appeals Board of 3 individuals designated or appointed by the Mayor with authority to hear and, subject to applicable law and the rules and regulations of the Mayor, make final administrative decisions on appeals taken from determinations and awards with respect to claims of employees."

D.C. Law 15-290 rewrote the section which had read:

"The Mayor may prescribe rules and regulations necessary for the administration and enforcement of this subchapter including rules and regulations for the conduct of hearings under § 1-623.24. The Mayor may determine the nature and extent of the proof and evidence required to establish the right to benefits under this subchapter without regard to the date of injury or death for which claim is made."

D.C. Law 16-91, in par. (4), validated a previously made technical correction.

D.C. Law 18-223, in subsec. (a), substituted "The Mayor shall promulgate rules necessary or useful for the administration and enforcement of this subchapter, including rules for modifying an award of compensation and for the conduct of hearings under § 1-623.24." for "The Mayor shall promulgate regulations that explain the standards and procedures that govern determinations for the modification of an award of compensation."
