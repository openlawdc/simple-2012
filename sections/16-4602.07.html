                <dd> A court of the District which has jurisdiction under this chapter to make a child-custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum. The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon motion of a party, the court's own motion, or request of another court.</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of the District shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors, including:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> Whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child;</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> The length of time the child has resided outside the District;</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> The distance between the court in the District and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;</dd>
            
                <dt>4</dt>
                <dd> The relative financial circumstances of the parties;</dd>
            
                <dt>5</dt>
                <dd> Any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;</dd>
            
                <dt>6</dt>
                <dd> The nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child;</dd>
            
                <dt>7</dt>
                <dd> The ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence; and</dd>
            
                <dt>8</dt>
                <dd> The familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> If a court of the District determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child-custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state and may impose any other condition the court considers just and proper.</dd>
            
                <dt>d</dt>
                <dd> A court of the District may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this chapter if a child-custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding.</dd>
