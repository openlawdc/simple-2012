                <p>The Commission may at any time, rescind, alter, modify, or amend its order. If, after appeal is filed, the Commission shall rescind the order or decision appealed from, the appeal shall be dismissed; if it shall alter, modify, or amend the same, such altered, modified, or amended order or decision shall take the place of the original order and the Court shall proceed thereon as though the late order had been made by the Commission in the first instance.</p>
