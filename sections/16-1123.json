Thereupon, the defendant shall be entitled to a judgment in his favor, but without costs, which judgment shall be a bar to any future action by the plaintiff against the defendant to recover the property for cause theretofore existing.","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., ยง 16-1123.\n\n1973 Ed., ยง 16-1123.\n\nDC CODE ยง 16-1123\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Dec. 23, 1963, 77 Stat. 568, Pub.
