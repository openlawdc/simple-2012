                <dd> Upon transfer of any special declarant right, the liability of a transferor declarant shall be as follows:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> A transferor shall not be relieved of any obligation or liability that arises before the transfer and shall remain liable for any warranty obligation imposed upon him or her by this chapter. Lack of privity shall not deprive any unit owner of standing to maintain an action to enforce any obligation of the transferor.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> If a successor to a special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant, the transferor shall be jointly and severally liable with the successor for any obligation or liability of the successor that relates to the condominium.</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> If a transferor retains a special declarant right, and transfers other special declarant rights to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor shall be liable for any obligation or liability imposed on a declarant by this chapter or by the condominium instruments that relates to the retained special declarant rights and that arises after the transfer.</dd>
            
                <dt>4</dt>

                <dd> A successor to any special declarant right, other than a successor described in paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection, who is not an affiliate of a declarant, shall be subject to any obligation or liability imposed by this chapter or the condominium instruments:</dd>

                <dt>ii</dt>
                <dd> A warranty obligation on improvements made by a previous declarant or made before the condominium was created;</dd>
            
                <dt>iii</dt>

                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> A successor who is not an affiliate of a declarant and whose sole right is a reservation in the condominium instruments to maintain models, sales offices, and signs may not exercise any other special declarant right and shall not be subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant, except a liability or obligation that arises under subchapter IV of this chapter that relates to disposition by the successor.</dd>
            
                <dt>4</dt>
                <dd> If the transferor is not an affiliate of the successor to special declarant rights and the successor succeeded to all the special declarant rights pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or a judgment or instrument that conveys title to units under subsection (c) of this section, the successor may declare his or her intention in a recorded instrument to hold the rights solely for transfer to another person. Until the successor transfers all special declarant rights to any person who acquires title to any unit owned by the successor, or until the successor records an instrument that permits exercise of all special declarant rights, the successor may not exercise the special declarant rights other than a right held by his or her transferor to control the executive board in accordance with the provisions of <a href='./42-1903.02.html'>§ 42-1903.02</a> for the duration of any period of declarant control. Any attempted exercise of special declarant rights other than a right held by the successor's transferor to control the executive board shall be void. For the period that a successor declarant may not exercise special declarant rights under this subsection, he or she shall not be subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant other than liability or obligation as a declarant for his or her acts or omissions under <a href='./42-1903.02.html'>§ 42-1903.02</a>.</dd>
            
                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd> Nothing in this section shall subject any successor to a special declarant right to any claim against or other obligation of a transferor declarant, other than a claim or obligation that arises under this chapter or the condominium instruments.</dd>
