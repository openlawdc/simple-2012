                <dd>(1)(A) In any proceeding between parents in which the custody of a child is raised as an issue, the best interest of the child shall be the primary consideration. The race, color, national origin, political affiliation, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression of a party, in and of itself, shall not be a conclusive consideration. The Court shall make a determination as to the legal custody and the physical custody of a child. A custody order may include:</dd>
            
                <dt>i</dt>
                <dd> sole legal custody;</dd>

                <dd> any other custody arrangement the Court may determine is in the best interest of the child.</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> For the purposes of this paragraph, the term:</dd>
            
                <dt>i</dt>
                <dd> "Legal custody" means legal responsibility for a child. The term "legal custody" includes the right to make decisions regarding that child's health, education, and general welfare, the right to access the child's educational, medical, psychological, dental, or other records, and the right to speak with and obtain information regarding the child from school officials, health care providers, counselors, or other persons interacting with the child.</dd>
            
                <dt>ii</dt>

There shall be a rebuttable presumption that joint custody is in the best interest of the child or children, except in instances where a judicial officer has found by a preponderance of the evidence that an intrafamily offense as defined in <a href='./16-1001.html'>§ 16-1001(8)</a>, an instance of child abuse as defined in section 102 of the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act of 1977, effective September 23, 1977 (D.C.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-91, in subpar. (a)(3)(P), substituted "or Program on Work" for "Program on Work".

D.C. Law 14-207, in the section heading, substituted "Custody of children." for "Retention of jurisdiction as to alimony and custody of children."; in subsec. (a), rewrote par (1), and in par. (3), substituted "a child" for "infant children" and in subpar. (K) of par. (3), deleted "or children's"; repealed subsec. (a-2); and added subsecs. (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j). Par. (1) of subsec. (a) and subsec. (a-2) had read as follows:

"(a)(1) After the issuance of a decree of divorce granting alimony and providing for the care and custody of children, the case shall still be considered open for any future orders relating to those matters. With respect to matters of custody and visitation, the race, color, national origin, political affiliation, sex, or sexual orientation, in and of itself, of a party shall not be a conclusive consideration."

"(a-2) The mere enactment of the Joint Custody of Children Act of 1996 does not, in and of itself, constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances and, therefore, may not constitute the sole basis for modifying or terminating a custody award."

D.C. Law 17-177, in subsec. (a)(1)(A), substituted "sexual orientation, gender identity or expression" for "or sexual orientation".

D.C. Law 17-368, in subsec. (a)(2), substituted "<a href='./16-1001.html'>§ 16-1001(8)</a>" for "D.C. Official Code <a href='./16-1001.html'>section 16-1001(5)</a>" in two places; and added subsec. (a-3).
