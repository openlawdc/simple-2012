If the Mayor finds that the issuance of a permit is inconsistent with the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan, but consistent with zoning, the Mayor shall defer issuance of the permit, and within 60 days, propose amendments to the zoning regulations or maps to eliminate the inconsistency of the zoning regulations with the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit the issuance of a building or construction permit that is inconsistent with zoning. The government issuance of public space permits shall also not be inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan."},{"prefix":"b","text":" If the Mayor finds that the issuance of any building or construction permit, which is not subject to subsection (a) of this section solely because of insufficient commercial square footage, would be inconsistent with the Land Use Element of the Plan, but consistent with zoning, the Mayor may defer the decision to issue the requested permit and, if he defers he shall propose, within 60 days, amendments to the zoning regulations or maps to eliminate any inconsistency of the zoning regulations with the Land Use Element of the Plan.

For purposes of this subsection, a major new building is defined as one specifically identified in the campus plan. Further, in order for the community to know as quickly as possible the substitute plans for the site, the review and approval of the new plans are to be done on an expedited basis. If the campus plan site is to remain vacant, or if the existing uses on that site are to remain, then the college or university is required to provide each affected Advisory Neighborhood Commission with written notice of that decision within 30 days of the college's or university's decision for movement. In such event, no further review by the Board of Zoning and Adjustment is required."}],"division":{"identifier":"I","text":"Government of District."},"title":{"identifier":"1","text":"Government Organization.
