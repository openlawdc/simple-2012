                <dd> A captive insurer or segregated account may take credit for the reinsurance of risks or portions of risks ceded to reinsurers in compliance with Chapter 5 of this title. Prior approval of the Commissioner shall be required for ceding or taking credit for the reinsurance of risks or portions of risks ceded to reinsurers not complying with Chapter 5 of this title, except for business written by an alien captive insurer outside of the United States.</dd>

                <dd> In addition to reinsurers authorized under Chapter 5 of this title, a captive insurer or segregated account may take credit for the reinsurance of risks or portions of risks ceded to a pool, exchange, or association acting as a reinsurer which has been authorized by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may require any other documents, financial information, or other evidence that the pool, exchange, or association will be able to provide adequate security for its financial obligations. The Commissioner may deny authorization or impose any limitations on the activities of a reinsurance pool, exchange, or association that, in the Commissioner's judgment, are necessary and proper to provide adequate security for the ceding captive insurer or segregated account and for the protection and consequent benefit of the public at large.</dd>
