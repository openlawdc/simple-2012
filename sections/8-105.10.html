                <dd> The Proposed Order may direct the user to do the following:</dd>

                <dd> WASA shall issue regulations which establish a schedule of escalating fines which may be imposed by WASA as part of its effort to enforce this subchapter through administrative action, provided that these fines may not exceed the fines which may be imposed in a civil proceeding brought pursuant to this subchapter. WASA shall also issue regulations to implement this subchapter, including regulations to establish procedures for conducting administrative enforcement actions pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. These regulations shall include, but need not be limited to, procedures and, where applicable, deadlines, for:</dd>

                <dd> Effecting service of any notice, order or other document produced by a person or issued by WASA pursuant to this subsection; provided, however, that WASA shall bear the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the Notice of Infraction was not defective, that the Notice of Infraction was properly served, and that an infraction occurred;</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> Answering or otherwise responding to any notice, order, or other document issued pursuant to this subsection;</dd>

The Court shall make a determination of each appeal on the basis of the record established before the hearing examiner, and may affirm, reverse, or modify the order of the hearing examiner, or may remand the case for further proceedings before the hearing examiner subject to the qualifications set forth in this subsection. The Court shall set aside any hearing examiner order that is unsupported by a preponderance of the evidence on the record. The Court shall also set aside any hearing examiner order that was made without observance of procedure required by law or regulations, except that in such instances, the Court shall apply the rule of harmless error. The Court may not modify a sanction imposed by the hearing examiner if that sanction is within the limits established by law or regulation.</dd>
