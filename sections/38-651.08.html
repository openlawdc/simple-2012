"(b) A school shall create and maintain a list of students with valid medication action plans, including the emergency contact information for each student. The principal of the school may distribute this list among appropriate school employees.

"(c) Each school that has a student with a medication action plan for self-administration may schedule a meeting at the beginning of the school year with the school nurse, the principal, the student, the responsible person, and any other appropriate school staff to review the student's medication action plan.
