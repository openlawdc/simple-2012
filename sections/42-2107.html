In transferring single-family dwellings with one dwelling unit, priority shall be given first to the sale to a low-income person and priority shall be given next to the sale for the development of rental units for low-income persons.   Any rules or factors developed by the Mayor for consideration in connection with the transfer of single-family and small multi-family dwellings shall be transmitted to the Council for review and approval pursuant to <a href='./42-2104.html'>§ 42-2104</a>.</dd>

Those individuals who do not elect to purchase shall have the right to relocation assistance, consistent with <a href='./42-3403.02.html'>§ 42-3403.02</a>. If the individual is an elderly tenant, within the meaning of <a href='./42-3402.08.html'>§ 42-3402.08</a>, he or she shall be entitled to the protection afforded by that section.</dd>

                <dd> The Mayor may provide to low-or moderate-income individuals a second mortgage not to exceed $10,000 per dwelling unit for the cost of repairs of the unit.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-11 rewrote subsec. (a); in subsec. (b) struck the phrase "residing in buildings" and insert the phrase "renting commercial space or residing in buildings" in its place, struck the phrase "tenant association" and inserted the phrase "condominium association, tenant association," in its place; in subsec. (c) added the phrase ", condominium association," after the phrase "nonprofit developer"; and in subsec. (d) inserted the phrase ", and commercial properties shall be offered to developers through a competitive bidding process" at the end of the sentence after the phrase "pursuant to <a href='./45-2704.html'>section 45- 2704</a>". Prior to amendment subsec. (a) provided:

"(a) The Administrator shall sell each residential building in the Program for $250 per dwelling unit and each commercial building for up to $5,000 per unit. Commercial, single-family, and small multi-family dwellings shall be sold at prices determined by the Administrator after considering the income level of the purchaser, the condition of the property, and such other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate pursuant to rules. In transferring single-family dwellings with one dwelling unit, priority shall be given to low-income persons. Any rules or factors developed by the Administrator for consideration in connection with the transfer of single-family and small multi-family dwellings shall be transmitted to the Council for review and approval pursuant to <a href='./45-2704.html'>§ 45-2704</a>."

D.C. Law 13-91 validated a previously made technical amendment.

D.C. Law 14-114, in subsec. (a), in the third sentence, substituted "priority shall be given first to the sale to a low-income person and priority shall be given next to the sale for the development of rental units for low-income persons" for "priority shall be given low-income persons"; in subsec. (d), substituted "potential homesteaders for the purchase of the building" for "potential homesteaders"; and substituted "Mayor" for "Administrator" throughout the section.
