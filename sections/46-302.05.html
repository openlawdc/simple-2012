Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-137 rewrote section, which had read as follows:

"§ 46-302.05. Continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

"(a) A tribunal of the District issuing a support order consistent with the law of the District has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a child support order:

"(1) As long as the District remains the residence of the obligor, the individual obligee, or the child for whose benefit the support order is issued; or

"(2) Until all of the parties who are individuals have filed written consent with the tribunal of the District for a tribunal of another state to modify the order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

"(b) A tribunal of the District issuing a child support order consistent with the law of the District may not exercise its continuing jurisdiction to modify the order if the order has been modified by a tribunal of another state pursuant to a law substantially similar to this chapter.

"(c) If a child support order of the District is modified by a tribunal of another state pursuant to a law substantially similar to this chapter, a tribunal of the District loses its continuing, exclusive jurisdiction with regard to prospective enforcement of the order issued in the District, and may only:

"(1) Enforce the order that was modified as to amounts accruing before the modification;

"(2) Enforce nonmodifiable aspects of that order; and

"(3) Provide other appropriate relief for violations of that order which occurred before the effective date of the modification.

"(d) A tribunal of the District shall recognize the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of a tribunal of another state which has issued a child support order pursuant to a law substantially similar to this chapter.

"(e) A temporary support order issued ex parte or pending resolution of a jurisdictional conflict does not create continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in the issuing tribunal.

"(f) A tribunal of the District issuing a support order consistent with the law of the District has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a spousal support order throughout the existence of the support obligation. A tribunal of the District may not modify a spousal support order issued by a tribunal of another state having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over that order under the law of that state."
