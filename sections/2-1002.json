{"text":"","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., § 1-2002.\n\n1973 Ed., § 1-1002.\n\nReferences in Text\n\nThe \"civil service and classification laws\", referred to in subsection (c) of this section, are set forth in Title 5, United States Code.\n\nSection 2-225.05, referred to in subsection (c), was repealed by D.C. Law 11- 259, § 405, 44 DCR 1423, effective April 12, 1997.\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nTransfer of Functions\n\nAll functions of the Commissioner of Public Buildings and of the Commissioner of Public Roads were transferred to the Administrator of General Services, and the Public Roads Administration, to be known as the Bureau of Public Roads, was transferred to the General Services Administration by § 103(a) of the Act of June 30, 1949, 63 Stat. 380. The office of the Commissioner of Public Buildings was abolished by § 103(b) of that Act. The Bureau of Public Roads was transferred to the Department of Commerce to be administered by the Commissioner of Public Roads subject to the direction and control of the Secretary of Commerce under the provisions of 1949 Reorganization Plan No. 7, § 1, 14 F.R. 5228, 63 Stat. 1070. The Commissioner of Public Roads was redesignated the Federal Highway Administrator by the Act of August 3, 1956, 70 Stat. 990, ch. 937, § 2. Section 3(f)(4) of the Department of Transportation Act provided for the transfer of the office of Federal Highway Administrator to and continuation within the Department of Transportation under the title of Director of Public Roads. Section 3(e) of the same Act established within the Department of Transportation a Federal Highway Administration, headed by an Administrator. A Public Buildings Service, under the direction of a Commissioner, was established December 11, 1949, by the Administrator of General Services, to supersede the abolished Public Buildings Administration. All functions of all other officers of the Department of the Interior and all functions of all agencies and employees of such Department were, with 2 exceptions, transferred to the Secretary of the Interior, with power vested in him to authorize their performance or the performance of any of his functions by any of such officers, agencies, and employees, by 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 3, §§ 1 and 2, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1262.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nRegional Planning Council abolished: The Regional Planning Council, referred to in paragraph (3) of subsection (e), was abolished by Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1966, 31 F.R. 11857.\n\nTermination of advisory committees: Section 14 of the Act of October 6, 1972, 86 Stat. 776, Pub.

Advisory committees established after January 5, 1973, were to terminate not later than the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on the date of their establishment, unless, in the case of a committee established by the President or an officer of the federal government, such committee was renewed by appropriate action prior to the expiration of such 2-year period, or in the case of a committee established by the Congress its duration is otherwise provided by law.\n\nAssignment of planning responsibilities under Pub. L. 93-198: Commissioner's Order No. 74-146, dated June 29, 1974 delegated the responsibility to develop local elements of the comprehensive plan and to coordinate the planning activities of the District of Columbia to the Director of the Office of Planning and Management, directed the designation of planning liaison officers in all departments and agencies of the District government, provided for the appointment of and staff support for a citizens' panel to advise the Director of Planning and Management in the preparation of the comprehensive plan, and designated the Director of Planning and Management as the alternate for the Mayor-Commissioner on the National Capital Planning Commission. These planning responsibilities were subsequently assigned to the Municipal Planning Office by Organization Order No. 50. The Municipal Planning Office was abolished by Mayor's Order No. 79-8, dated January 2, 1979, and the duties, functions, and resources of the Municipal Planning Office were transferred to the Office of Planning and Development by Mayor's Order No. 79-9, dated January 2, 1979.\n\nComprehensive plan goals and policies: Act of March 3, 1979, D.C.

Law 8-132, amended Titles I through VIII, X and XI, and added Title XII to the District of Columbia Comprehensive Plan of 1984, adopted by D.C. Law 5-76. D.C.

Law 5-76, § 6(b) of D.C. Law 5-187, and § 4(b) of D.C.
