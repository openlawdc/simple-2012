Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-137 rewrote section, which had read as follows:

"<a href='./46-302.06.html'>§ 46-302.06</a>. Enforcement and modification of support order by tribunal having continuing jurisdiction.

"(a) A tribunal of the District may serve as an initiating tribunal to request a tribunal of another state to enforce or modify a support order issued in that state.

"(b) A tribunal of the District having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a support order may act as a responding tribunal to enforce or modify the order. If a party subject to the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal no longer resides in the issuing state, in subsequent proceedings the tribunal may apply <a href='./46-303.15.html'>§ 46-303.15</a> (special rules of evidence and procedure) to receive evidence from another state and <a href='./46-303.17.html'>§ 46-303.17</a> (assistance with discovery) to obtain discovery through a tribunal of another state.

"(c) A tribunal of the District which lacks continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a spousal support order may not serve as a responding tribunal to modify a spousal support order of another state."
