References in Text

"The 1st section of the Act of March 3, 1881 (<a href='./47-211.html'>§ 47-211</a>)," referred to in this section, appears identical with the original. However, the citation to <a href='./47-211.html'>§ 47-211</a> appears to be erroneous, as that section is based on § 14 of 28 Stat. 285, approved August 14, 1894, rather than the 1881 Act.
