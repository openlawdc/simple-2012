Legislative History of Laws

Law 6-66, "Student Health Care Act of 1985," was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 6-135, which was referred to the Committee on Education and reassigned to the Committee on Human Services. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on September 10, 1985, and September 24, 1985, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on October 9, 1985, it was assigned Act No. 6-89 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review.

Editor's Notes

Because of the codification of D.C. Law 7-45 as subchapter II of this chapter, and the designation of the preexisting text of this chapter as subchapter I, "subchapter" has been substituted for "chapter" in the introductory language.

Delegation of Authority

Delegation of Authority Pursuant to D.C. Law 6-66, the "Student Health Care Act of 1985", see Mayor's Order 2004-102, June 14, 2004 (51 DCR 6669).

Miscellaneous Notes
