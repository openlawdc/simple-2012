Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-176, in subsec. (c), substituted "spouse, or domestic partner as defined in § 32-701(3)," for "spouse".

D.C. Law 16-15, in subsec. (b), substituted "subchapters IV and V of this chapter, the terms 'sell' or 'sale' include, but are not limited to, the execution of any agreement pursuant to which the owner of the housing accommodation agrees to some, but not all, of the following:" for "this subchapter, the terms 'sell' or 'sale' include the execution of any agreement that assigns, leases, or encumbers property, pursuant to which the owner"; rewrote subsec. (c); and added subsec. (d). Prior to amendment, subsec. (c) read as follows:

"(c) For the purposes of this subchapter, the term "sell" or "sale" includes the transfer of 100% of all partnership interests in a partnership which owns the accommodation as its sole asset to 1 transferee or of 100% of all stock of a corporation which owns the accommodation as its sole asset to 1 transferee in 1 or more transactions occurring during a period of 1 year from the date of the first such transfer, and a master lease which meets some, but not all, of the factors described in subsection (b) of this section or which is similar in effect. For the purposes of this subchapter, the term "sell" or "sale" does not include a transfer, even though for consideration, by a decedent's estate to members of the decedent's family if the consideration arising from such transfer will pass from the decedent's estate to, or solely for the benefit of, charity. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "member's of the decedent's family" means (i) a surviving spouse, or domestic partner as defined in § 32-701(3), of the decedent, lineal descendants of the decedent, or spouses of lineal descendants of the decedent, (ii) a trust for the primary benefit of the persons referred to in clause (i), and (iii) a partnership, corporation, or other entity controlled by the individuals referred to in clauses (i) and (ii). The term "sell" or "sale" does not include a foreclosure sale, a tax sale, or a bankruptcy sale. An owner who is uncertain as to the applicability of this subchapter is deemed to be an aggrieved owner for the purposes of seeking declaratory relief under §§ 42-3405.03 and 42-3405.03a.   The tenant or tenant organization in such an accommodation is deemed to be an aggrieved tenant or tenant organization, as applicable, for these purposes.  This subsection shall not apply to any transaction involving accommodations otherwise subject hereto expressly contemplated by a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to February 22, 1994."

D.C. Law 16-191, in subsecs. (b), (c)(3), and (d)(5)(A), validated previously made technical corrections.

D.C. Law 17-40, in subsec. (c)(2), added subpar. (H-i).

D.C. Law 17-231, in subsec. (c)(2)(B), substituted "spouses" for "husband and wife".
