        <h1>§ 42-3502.06 Rent ceilings abolished.</h1>
        

        
        <dl>
            
                <dt>a</dt>
                <dd> Rent ceilings are abolished, except that the housing provider may implement, in accordance with § 42-3502.08(g), rent ceiling adjustments pursuant to petitions and voluntary agreements approved by the Rent Administrator prior to August 5, 2006. Petitions and voluntary agreements pending as of August 5, 2006, shall be decided pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter in effect prior to August 5, 2006, and may be implemented in accordance with § 42-3502.08(g). In considering a hardship petition pursuant to § 42-3502.12, any unimplemented rent charged increase pursuant to a petition or voluntary agreement approved by the Rent Administrator shall be included in the maximum possible rental income. Except to the extent provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, no housing provider of any rental unit subject to this chapter may charge or collect rent for the rental unit in excess of the amount computed by adding to the base rent not more than all rent increases authorized after April 30, 1985, for the rental unit by this chapter, by prior rent control laws and any administrative decision under those laws, and by a court of competent jurisdiction. No tenant may sublet a rental unit at a rent greater than that tenant pays the housing provider.</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> On an annual basis, the Rental Housing Commission shall determine an adjustment of general applicability in the rent charged established by subsection (a) of this section. This adjustment of general applicability shall be equal to the change during the previous calendar year, ending each December 31, in the Washington, D.C., Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for all items during the preceding calendar year. No adjustment of general applicability shall exceed 10%. A housing provider may not implement an adjustment of general applicability, or an adjustment permitted by subsection (c) of this section for a rental unit within 12 months of the effective date of the previous adjustment of general applicability, or instead, an adjustment permitted by subsection (c) of this section in the rent charged for that unit.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> At the housing provider's election, instead of any adjustment authorized by subsection (b) of this section, the rent charged for an accommodation may be adjusted through a hardship petition under § 42-3502.12. Such a petition shall be clearly identified as an election instead of the general adjustments authorized by subsection (b) of this section. The Rent Administrator shall accord an expedited review process for these petitions and shall issue and publish a final decision within 90 days after the petition has been filed. In the case of any petition filed under this subsection as to which a final decision has not been rendered by the Rent Administrator at the end of 90 days from the date of filing of the petition and as to which the housing provider is not in default in complying with any information request made under § 42- 3502.16, the rent charged adjustment requested in the petition may be conditionally implemented by the housing provider at the end of the 90-day period. The conditional rent charged adjustment shall be subject to subsequent modification by the final decision of the Rent Administrator on the petition. If a hearing has been held on the petition, the Rent Administrator shall, by order served upon the parties at least 10 days prior to the expiration of the 90 days, make a provisional finding as to the rent charged adjustment justified by the order, if any. Except to the extent modified by this section, the adjustment procedures of § 42-3502.16 shall apply to any adjustment.</dd>
            
                <dt>d</dt>
                <dd> If on July 17, 1985 the rent being charged exceeds the allowable rent ceiling, that rent shall be reduced to the allowable rent ceiling effective the next date that the rent is due. This subsection shall not apply to any rent administratively approved under the Rental Accommodations Act of 1975, the Rental Housing Act of 1977, or the Rental Housing Act of 1980, or any rent increase authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction. The housing provider shall notify the tenant in writing of any decrease required under this chapter before the effective date of the decrease.</dd>
            
                <dt>e</dt>
                <dd> A tenant may challenge a rent adjustment implemented under any section of this chapter by filing a petition with the Rent Administrator under § 42- 3502.16. No petition may be filed with respect to any rent adjustment, under any section of this chapter, more than 3 years after the effective date of the adjustment, except that a tenant must challenge the new base rent as provided in § 42-3501.03(4) within 6 months from the date the housing provider files his base rent as required by this chapter.</dd>
            
                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd>(1) Unless permitted under § 42-3502.10(j), a capital improvement increase in the rent charged as provided under § 42-3502.10 shall not be assessed against any elderly tenant or tenant with a disability who leases and occupies a rental unit regulated under this chapter.</dd>

                <dt>2A</dt>
                <dd>(A) In making a determination that a tenant qualifies as a tenant with a disability under this subsection, the Mayor shall limit the inquiry to the minimum information and documentation necessary to establish that the tenant meets the definition of a person with a disability and shall not inquire further into the nature or severity of the disability. The Mayor shall not require the tenant to provide a description of the disability when making an eligibility determination; provided, that the Mayor shall require that a physician or other licensed healthcare professional verify that a tenant meets the definition of a person with a disability. The Mayor shall not require the tenant to provide eligibility documentation in less than 30 days.</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> The Mayor shall maintain records of the information compiled under this paragraph; provided, that the Mayor shall not disclose information about a tenant's disability unless the disclosure is required by law.</dd>
            
                <dt>C</dt>
                <dd> The Mayor shall develop such forms and procedures as may be necessary to verify eligibility under this subsection.</dd>

The credit shall be taken against the next installment or installments of real property taxes payable to the District of Columbia coming due with respect to the housing accommodation, inclusive of the land on which it is located.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> If an elderly or disabled tenant exempted from capital improvement rent increases pursuant to this chapter should cease to reside in a rental unit, the tax credit allowed to the housing provider for that rental unit shall also cease.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-145, in subsec. (a), inserted the first three sentences; and, in subsecs. (b), (c), and (f)(3), substituted "rent charged" for "rent ceiling".

D.C. Law 16-240 rewrote subsec. (f)(2)(A) and added subsec. (f)(2)(2A). Prior to amendment, subsec. (f)(2)(A) read as follows:

"(A) 'Disabled tenant' means an individual who has a medically determinable physical impairment, including blindness, which prohibits and incapacitates 75% of that person's ability to move about, to assist himself or herself, or to engage in an occupation, and has an income of not more than $40,000 per year at the time of approval by the Rent Administrator of a petition for capital improvements pursuant to § 42-3502.10."

D.C. Law 16-294, in subsec. (a), made a technical correction that made no change in text.

D.C. Law 16-305, in subsec. (f)(1), substituted "tenant or tenant with a disability" for "or disabled tenant"; and, in subsec. (f)(2), purported to substitute "Tenant with a disability" for "Disabled tenant".

D.C. Law 17-353 , in the section heading, substituted "Rent ceilings abolished" for "Rent ceiling", and validated a previously made technical correction in subsec. (a).
