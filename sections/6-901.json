(a) which had read: \"The Mayor of the District of Columbia is authorized to examine into the sanitary condition of all buildings in said District, to condemn those buildings which are in such insanitary condition as to endanger the health or lives of the occupants thereof or persons living in the vicinity, and to cause all buildings to be put into sanitary condition or to be demolished and removed as may be required by the provisions of this chapter\"; in the third sentence of subsec. (a), substituted \"into the habitability and sanitary condition of a building\" for \"into the sanitary condition of any building\"; inserted the last sentence of subsec. (a); and added subsec. (b).\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nFor D.C. Law 13-281, see notes following § 6-801.\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nDC CODE § 6-901\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(May 1, 1906, 34 Stat. 157, ch. 2073, § 1; Aug. 28, 1954, 68 Stat. 884, ch. 1032; Apr. 27, 2001, D.C.
