                <dt>A</dt>
                <dd> After an APS worker conducts an investigation under <a href='./7-1904.html'>§ 7-1904</a>, the Department determines that an adult is in need of protective services due to abuse, neglect, or exploitation by a third party;</dd>

                <dd> When determining the appropriateness of particular services, the Department or other designated agency shall first consider those protective services that encourage maximum self-determination and are least restrictive of personal liberty.</dd>
            
                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd> No provision of subsections (a-1) or (c-1) of this section shall be construed to create an entitlement (either direct or implied) on the part of any individual or family to any services under this chapter for an adult who meets the criteria for self-neglect or who is determined to be at risk due to self-neglect.</dd>
