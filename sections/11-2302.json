The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C.

These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made, in brackets, in this section.\n\nDC CODE § 11-2302\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(July 29, 1970, 84 Stat. 518, Pub.
