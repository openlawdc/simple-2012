"(ii) The Commission shall make a determination of feasibility under sub-subparagraph (i) of this subparagraph within 6 months after the date on which an electricity supplier receives a license under <a href='./34-1505.html'>§ 34-1505</a>.

"(B) If the Commission determines under subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph that it is feasible for an electricity supplier to disclose the fuel mix of the electricity sold by that supplier in the District of Columbia, the Commission, by regulation or order, shall require the electricity supplier to disclose every 6 months the fuel mix of the electricity sold by the supplier in the District of Columbia, including categories of electricity from coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, oil, hydroelectric, solar, biomass, wind, and other sources.
