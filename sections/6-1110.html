Legislative History of Laws

For legislative history of D.C. Law 2-144, see Historical and Statutory Notes following § 6-1101.

Law 6-42, the "Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs Civil Infractions Act of 1985," was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 6-187, which was referred to the Committee on Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on June 25, 1985, and July 9, 1985, respectively.

Editor's Notes

Because of the codification of D.C. Law 5-69 as subchapter II of this chapter, and the designation of the preexisting text of Chapter 11 as subchapter I, "subchapter" has been substituted for "chapter," where applicable, in this section.

Miscellaneous Notes

Applicability: Section 4 of D.C. Law 16-189 provides: "The implementation of the provisions of this act is subject to appropriations and nothing in this act shall be construed to create an entitlement."
