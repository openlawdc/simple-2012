Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-277, in subsec. (a), substituted "with the Agency" for "with the Division" and substituted "either the Agency" for "either the department of Human Services".

D.C. Law 15-341 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"(a) The primary responsibility for the initial investigation is with the police in cases of an allegedly abused child and with the Agency in other cases of an allegedly neglected child: Provided, however, that the investigation of a report involving acts or omissions of either the Agency or the police shall be conducted by the department which is not involved.

"(b) The purpose of the initial investigation shall be to determine:

"(1) The nature, extent, and cause of the abuse or neglect;

"(2) The identity of the person responsible for the abuse or neglect;

"(3) The name, age, sex, and condition of the abused or neglected child and all other children in the home;

"(4) The conditions in the home at the time of the investigation;

"(5) Whether there is any child in the home whose health, safety, or welfare is in jeopardy because of his or her treatment in the home or his or her home environment; and

"(6) Whether any child who is in jeopardy because of treatment in the home or his or her home environment should be removed from the home or can be protected by the provision of resources such as those listed in <a href='./4-1303.04.html'>§ 4-1303.04</a>."
