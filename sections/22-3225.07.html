Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-254, in subsec. (b), struck "The court or prosecutor" and inserted " The Commissioner, court, or prosecutor", and deleted the second sentence which had read: "The Commissioner shall hold a disciplinary hearing to determine whether the license or certificate of authority of the convicted practitioner should be suspended or revoked."

D.C. Law 16-144, in subsec. (a), substituted "offenses of insurance fraud in the first degree or the second degree" for "offense of insurance fraud in the first degree".
