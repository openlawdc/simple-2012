Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-204, in subsec. (d), designated existing text as paragraph (1); in newly designated paragraph (1), substituted "of not more than 14 days duration, subject to extensions as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection" for "of not more than 14 days duration"; and inserted new paragraphs (2), (3) and (4).

D.C. Law 17-353 validated a previously made technical correction.

D.C. Law 17-368 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:

"(a) Upon a filing of a petition for civil protection by the Corporation Counsel or by a complainant, the Family Division shall set the matter for hearing, consolidating it, where appropriate, with other matters before the Family Division involving members of the same family.

"(b) With respect to a petition for civil protection filed by the Corporation Counsel, the Family Division shall cause notice of the hearing to be served on the respondent, the complainant and, if appropriate, the family member endangered (or, if a child, the person then having physical custody of the child), the Director of Social Services, and the Corporation Counsel. The respondent shall be served with a copy of the petition together with the notice and shall be directed to appear at the hearing. The Family Division may also cause notice to be served on other members of the family whose presence at the hearing is necessary to the proper disposition of the matter.

"(c) With respect to a petition for civil protection filed by a complainant himself or herself, the complainant, pursuant to the Rules of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, shall cause notice of the hearing and a copy of the petition to be served upon the respondent and any other members of the family whose presence at the hearing is necessary to the proper disposition of the matter. Pursuant to the Rules of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, the complainant shall also cause a subpoena to issue directing the respondent to appear at the hearing.

"(d)(1) If, upon the filing of a petition under oath, the Division finds that the safety or welfare of a family member is immediately endangered by the respondent, it may, ex parte, issue a temporary protection order of not more than 14 days duration, subject to extensions provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, and direct that the order be served along with the notice required by this section; provided, that a petition for civil protection be filed together with the petition for a temporary protection order and a hearing be commenced on the petition for civil protection prior to the expiration of the temporary protection order.

"(2) If the 14th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or a day on which weather or other conditions cause the Superior Court of the District of Columbia ("Court") to be closed, the duration of the temporary protection order shall extend until the next day in which the Court is open.

"(3) All temporary protection orders issued pursuant to this subsection shall include language explaining, as a matter of law, that if the day on which they are set to expire is a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or a day on which the weather or other conditions cause the Court to be closed, that the temporary protection order shall be extended for the duration provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.

"(4) For the purposes of this subsection, the term "legal holiday" means any day observed as a holiday by the Court."
