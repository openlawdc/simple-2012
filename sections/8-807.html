Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-115 rewrote subsec. (f), which previously read:

"(f)(1) The District shall have a continuing lien upon any land and the improvements on the land to which fines or penalties have been imposed pursuant to this chapter. Each lien placed pursuant to this chapter shall be filed at the Office of the Recorder of Deeds.

"(2) The lien shall have priority over all other liens except liens for District taxes and District water and sewer charges.

"(3) If any civil fine, penalty, or cost is unpaid 6 months after the date of the final notice of the charges, the subject property may be sold for the unpaid civil fine, penalty, cost, and interest due the District government at the next tax sale conducted pursuant to <a href='./47-1301.html'>§ 47-1301</a> in the same manner and under the same conditions as property sold for delinquent general taxes.

"(4) The proceeds of the sale shall be credited to the General Fund of the District of Columbia for use in accordance with <a href='./6-3415.html'>§ 6-3415</a>.

"(5) For the purposes of any property sold pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, the redemption period specified in §<a href='./47-1304.html'>§ 47-1304</a>, 47-1306, 47-1307, 47-1312, and 47-847, shall be 6 months."

D.C. Law 13-172, rewrote subsec. (f), which had read:

"(f)(1) The District shall levy and collect a special assessment against any land and the improvements on the land to which any unpaid fines or penalties have been imposed pursuant to this act. A special assessment levied pursuant to this act shall be filed at the Office of Recorder of Deeds.

"(2) The special assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary District real property taxes are collected pursuant to D.C. Code <a href='./47-811.html'>§ 47-811(b)</a>. In addition, the special assessment shall be subject to the same penalties and interest as provided in D.C. Code <a href='./47-811.html'>§ 47-811(c)</a>, and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided in Chapter 13 of Title 47 of the District of Columbia Code. The special assessment shall be subordinate to all existing special assessments previously imposed upon the same land and paramount to all liens except liens for District taxes and water and sewer charges. The special assessment shall continue until the special assessment and all interest due and payable has been paid."

D.C. Law 14-78 rewrote subsec. (f); in subsec. (h)(1), substituted "may" for "shall"; and added subsec. (i). Prior to amendment, subsec. (f) read as follows:

"(f)(1) The District shall levy a special assessment against any land and the improvements on the land to which any unpaid fines or penalties have been imposed pursuant to this chapter. Any special assessment levied pursuant to this chapter shall be filed with the Office of the Recorder of Deeds.

"(2) The special assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary District real property taxes are collected under <a href='./47-811.html'>§ 47- 811(b)</a>. In addition, the special assessment shall be subject to the same penalties and interest as provided in <a href='./47-811.html'>§ 47-811(c)</a> and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided in Chapter 13 of Title 47. The special assessment shall be subordinate to all existing special assessments previously imposed on the same land and paramount to all liens except liens for District taxes and District water and sewer charges. The special assessment shall continue until the special assessment and all interest due and payable thereon has been paid."
