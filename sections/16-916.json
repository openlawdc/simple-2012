(f), which had read as follows:\n\n\"(f) Any court order that establishes a retroactive amount of child support or a judgment for unreimbursed public assistance shall be established in accordance with section 16-916.01 and shall take into consideration either the current earnings and income of the noncustodial parent at the time the order is set or the earnings and income of the noncustodial parent during the period for which retroactive child support or unreimbursed public assistance is sought. To overcome the presumptive support amount, the court may consider the obligor's ability to pay back support and concurrently maintain current payments.\"\n\nD.C. Law 17-128 rewrote subsecs.

The court may order either or both parents to provide health insurance coverage for the child, or to pay the unreimbursed medical expenses of the child. In all cases where health insurance coverage is available to either or both parents at reasonable cost, the court shall order either or both parents with health insurance coverage available to provide the coverage, unless a party establishes that the provision of health insurance coverage would be contrary to the best interests of the child.\n\n\"(c-2) In selecting among health insurance coverage options, the court shall consider, at a minimum, the cost, comprehensiveness, accessibility, and continuing availability of all health insurance coverage available to either parent.\n\n\"(c-3) For the purposes of this section, health insurance coverage shall be considered reasonable in cost if it is employer-related or other group health insurance coverage, regardless of the service delivery mechanism.\"\n\nD.C.
