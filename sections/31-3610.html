                <dd> Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a long-term care insurance policy may not be delivered or issued for delivery in the District of Columbia unless the policyholder or certificate holder has been offered the option of purchasing a policy or certificate including a nonforfeiture benefit. The offer of a nonforfeiture benefit may be in the form of a rider that is attached to the policy. In the event the policyholder or certificate holder declines the nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer shall provide a contingent benefit upon lapse that shall be available for a specified period of time following a substantial increase in premium rates.</dd>

                <dd> When a group long-term care insurance policy is issued, the offer required in subsection (a) of this section shall be made to the group policyholder. If, however, the policy is issued as a group long-term care insurance as described in <a href='./31-3601.html'>§ 31-3601(4)(D)</a>, other than a continuing care retirement community or other similar entity, the offering shall be made to each proposed certificate holder.</dd>

                <dd> The Commissioner shall promulgate regulations specifying the type or types of nonforfeiture benefits to be offered as part of long-term care insurance policies and certificates, the standards for nonforfeiture benefits, and the rules regarding a contingent benefit upon lapse, including a determination of the specified period of time during a contingent benefit upon lapse will be available and the substantial premium rate increase that triggers a contingent benefit upon lapse as described in subsection (a) of this section.</dd>
