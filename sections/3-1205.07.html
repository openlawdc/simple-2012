Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 18-26 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:

"Each board shall issue a license by reciprocity or endorsement to an applicant:

"(1) Who is licensed or certified and in good standing under the laws of another state with requirements which, in the opinion of the Board, were substantially equivalent at the time of licensure to the requirements of this chapter, and which state admits health professionals licensed by the District in a like manner; or

"(2) Who is certified or accredited by a recognized national accrediting association, acceptable to the Board, as a qualified professional according to standards that were the substantial equivalent at the time of the certification or accreditation to the standards for that profession as set forth in this chapter and who has continually remained in good standing with the certifying or accrediting association from the date of certification or accrediting until the date of licensing; and

"(3) Who pays the applicable fees established by the Mayor."

D.C. Law 19-171, in subsec. (a)(2), validated a previously made technical correction.
