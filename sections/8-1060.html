Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-15, in subsec. (c), added the two last two sentences, added subsec. (g), and rewrote subsec. (d), which previously read:

"Any solid waste facility that is not in compliance with the requirements of this subchapter, regulations promulgated to implement this subchapter, or any permit term or condition shall, upon a finding of noncompliance by the Departments of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, Public Works, or Health, or by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, be closed. Any facility so closed may file a petition with the Department finding it in noncompliance, for a hearing to allow it to reopen. At the hearing, the facility must prove that it has come into compliance, or has a plan to come into compliance which shall be implemented before the facility may reopen. In allowing a facility to reopen, the Department may impose additional terms and conditions as it deems proper and necessary to protect the public health and safety and to carry out the purposes of this subchapter. These conditions may include, but are not limited to, requiring a facility to pay reasonable fees for independent experts, sample testing, and government costs in monitoring the petitioning facility's compliance, before or after a finding of noncompliance is made."
