                <p>An obligation of a limited partnership, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not be the obligation of a limited partner. A limited partner shall not be personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for an obligation of the limited partnership solely by reason of being a limited partner, even if the limited partner participates in the management and control of the limited partnership.</p>
