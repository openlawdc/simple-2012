The Mayor is authorized to employ a director and such other personal services as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter. The Mayor shall fix the compensation of the members of said Agency without reference to the provisions of the Classification Act of 1923; provided, however, that the compensation of any members shall not exceed $500 per annum; and provided further, that no compensation for services as a member of such agency shall be provided for any member who holds a salaried public office or position, in the District of Columbia or the federal government."
