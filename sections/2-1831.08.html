        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-83 rewrote subsec. (c) which read as follows:

"(c) The initial term of office of an Administrative Law Judge shall be 2 years, at the end of which the Administrative Law Judge shall be eligible for reappointment to a term of 10 years. At the expiration of any 10-year term of office, an Administrative Law Judge shall be eligible for reappointment by the Commission to a new term of 10 years. Non-reappointment of an Administrative Law Judge shall not be deemed to be discipline or removal of the Administrative Law Judge."

D.C. Law 16-191, in subsec. (c)(1), validated a previously made technical correction.
