                <dd> During the period 1970 and 1980 the percentage of mothers with young children in the labor force rose, resulting in a greater proportion of pre-school children requiring child care services.</dd>

                <dd> Eighty percent of women in the work force are of childbearing age, and 93% of them are expected to become pregnant at some point in their careers.</dd>

                <dd> There is a substantial need to provide adequate child care facilities for District of Columbia ("District") government employees that are low cost, safe, and convenient to the job site.</dd>

                <dd> Recruitment efforts will attract quality personnel because the provision of child care services is an incentive for reliable and responsible family members.</dd>
