                <dd> A lender shall not pay a contractor under a home improvement contract from the proceeds of a covered loan other than by an instrument payable to the borrower or jointly payable to the borrower and the contractor or, at the election of the borrower, through a third-party escrow agent that is independent from the contractor in accordance with the terms established in a written agreement signed by the borrower, the mortgage lender, and the contractor prior to the disbursement of funds to the contractor. The borrower shall be responsible for any reasonable fees or costs associated with the election. A lender may conclusively rely on a certified written statement from either the contractor or the third-party escrow agent that states that the escrow agent and contractor are independent from each other.</dd>
