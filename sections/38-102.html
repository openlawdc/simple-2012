Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-149 rewrote this section, which formerly read:

"The Board shall determine all questions of general policy relating to the schools, shall appoint the executive officers hereinafter provided for, define their duties, and direct expenditures. All expenditures of public funds for such school purposes shall be made and accounted for as now provided by law under the direction and control of the Mayor of the District of Columbia. The Board shall appoint all teachers in the manner hereinafter prescribed and all other employees provided for in this chapter."

Section 7 of D.C. Law 13-149 provides:

"This act shall apply upon the effective date of the School Governance Charter Amendment Act of 2000."

D.C. Law 17-353, in the section credit, validated a previously made technical correction.

Legislative History of Laws

For D.C. Law 13-149, see notes following <a href='./38-101.html'>§ 38-101</a>.

Law 17-353, the "Technical Amendments Act of 2008", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 17-994 which was referred to the Committee of the Whole. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on December 2, 2008, and December 16, 2008, respectively.   Signed by the Mayor on January 15, 2009, it was assigned Act No. 17-687 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review.   D.C. Law 17-353 became effective on March 25, 2009.

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, § 711 (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.11.html'>§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.14.html'>§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.
