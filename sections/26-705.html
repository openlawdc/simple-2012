Divestiture shall not be required if (1) the District bank holding company or the regional bank holding company ceases to be a District bank holding company or a regional bank holding company, as the case may be, because of an increase in the deposits held by bank subsidiaries not located within the region and if the increase is not the result of an acquisition of a bank holding company or bank, or (2) a District bank or District bank holding company ceases to be a District bank or District bank holding company because of an acquisition authorized by this subchapter.</dd>

Editor's Notes

Because of the codification of D.C. Law 11-142 as subchapter II of Chapter 8 [subchapter II of Chapter 7, 2001 Ed.], and the designation of the preexisting text as subchapter I, "subchapter" has been substituted for "chapter" in (b).
