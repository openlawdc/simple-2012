        <h1>§ 16-920 Effective date of decree or judgment for annulment or absolute divorce.</h1>
        
            
                <p>A decree or judgment annulling or dissolving a marriage, or granting an absolute divorce, shall become effective to dissolve the bonds of matrimony 30 days after the docketing of the decree or judgment unless either party applies for a stay with the Superior Court of the District of Columbia or the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. If the application for a stay is denied, the judgment will become final upon entry of the court's order denying the stay. If the application for a stay is granted, the stay shall continue in effect until the conclusion of the appeal. If the parties desire immediate finality, they may file a joint waiver of the right to appeal, which will make the decree or judgment final upon docketing of the joint waiver.</p>
