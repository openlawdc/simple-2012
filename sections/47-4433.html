        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-217, in subsec. (a), substituted "that he or she may file a protest with the Office of Administrative Hearings to challenge the proposed refund offset within 30 days of service of the notice." for "and provide a period of at least 30 days after the notice is sent to the taxpayer to file a protest."; rewrote subsec. (b); and, in subsec. (c), substituted "Office of Administrative Hearings" for "Mayor". Prior to amendment, subsec. (b) had read as follows:

'(b) If a protest is filed within the period set forth in the notice, an administrative hearing shall be granted by the Mayor. The Mayor shall promptly notify the taxpayer of the final determination of the protest. If no protest is filed within the period, a refund offset or apportionment, as determined by the Mayor, shall be final."
