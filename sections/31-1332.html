                <dt>d</dt>
                <dd> The liquidator's proposal shall, with respect to an insolvent insurer writing life or health insurance or annuities, provide for disbursements of assets to any guaranty association or any foreign guaranty association covering life or health insurance or annuities, or to any other entity or organization reinsuring, assuming, or guaranteeing policies or contracts of insurance under the acts creating the associations.</dd>
            
                <dt>e</dt>
                <dd> Notice of the application shall be given to the association in and to the commissioners of insurance of each of the states.
