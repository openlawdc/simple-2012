Miscellaneous Notes

Section 4 of D.C. Law 18-127 provides that this act shall apply upon inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan.

The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of February 15, 2012, that the fiscal effect of Law 18-127 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 18-127, are not in effect.
