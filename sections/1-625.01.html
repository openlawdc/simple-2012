Miscellaneous Notes

Section 8(a) of D.C. Law 18-335 provides that Law 18-18-335 shall apply upon enactment by the Congress of an act excluding the District of Columbia from coverage of 5 U.S.C. §§ 7321 through 7326 (Hatch Act).

Section 8(b) of D.C. Law 18-335 provides that this act shall apply upon inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan.

The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of February 15, 2012, that the fiscal effect of Law 18-335 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of Law 18-335 that might affect this section are not in effect.
