"(b) On or before January 1, 2012, all applicants for construction governed by <a href='./6-1451.03.html'>§ 6-1451.03</a> shall provide a performance bond, which shall be due and payable prior to receipt of a certificate of occupancy."

"(c) For the purpose of compliance with subsections (a) and (b) of this section, in lieu of the bond required by this section, the Mayor may accept an irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution authorized to do business in the District or evidence of cash deposited in an escrow account in a financial institution in the District in the name of the licensee and the District. The letter of credit or escrow account shall be in the amounts required by subsection (d) of this section.

"(d) The amount of the required bond under subsection (a) of this section shall be 1% of the incentive provided.
