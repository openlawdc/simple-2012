The additional period or periods of detention may be granted only on the basis of good cause shown, including due diligence and materiality, and shall be granted only for the additional time required to prepare for the expedited indictment and trial of the person. Good cause may include, but is not limited to, the unavailability of an essential witness, the necessity for forensic analysis of evidence, the ability to conduct a joint trial with a co-defendant or co-defendants, severance of co-defendants which permits only one trial to commence within the time period, complex or major investigations, complex or difficult legal issues, scheduling conflicts which arise shortly before the scheduled trial date, the inability to proceed to trial because of action taken by or at the behest of the defendant, an agreement between the government and the defense to dispose of the case by a guilty plea on or after the scheduled trial date, or the breakdown of a plea on or immediately before the trial date, and allowing reasonable time to prepare for an expedited trial after the circumstance giving rise to a tolling or extension of the 100-day period no longer exists.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 13-310, in subsec. (a), inserted "or misdemeanor" following "felony" in par. (1)(A), and inserted "or, when a hearing under <a href='./23-1329.html'>§ 23-1329(b)</a> is requested, is likely to violate a condition of release" in par. (2); in subsec. (f)(2)(B), substituted "immediate arrest or" for "the immediate"; and rewrote subsec. (h) which had read:

"(h) The case of the person detained pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall be placed on an expedited calendar and, consistent with the sound administration of justice, the person shall be indicted before the expiration of 90 days, and shall have trial of the case commence before the expiration of 100 days. However, the person may be detained for an additional period not to exceed 20 days from the date of the expiration of the 100-day period on the basis of a petition submitted by the attorney for the government and approved by the judicial officer. The additional period of detention may be granted only on the basis of good cause shown and shall be granted only for the additional time required to prepare for the expedited trial of the person. For the purposes of determining the maximum period of detention under this section, the period shall not exceed 120 days. The period shall:

"(1) Begin on the date defendant is first detained after arrest; and

"(2) Include the days detained pending a detention hearing and the days in confinement on temporary detention under subsection (a) of this section whether or not continuous with full pretrial detention. The defendant shall be treated in accordance with <a href='./23-1321.html'>§ 23-1321(a)</a> unless the trial is in progress, has been delayed by the timely filing of motions excluding motions for continuance, or has been delayed at the request of the defendant."

D.C. Law 14-134, in subsec. (a)(1)(C), substituted "Probation, parole, or supervised release" for "Probation or parole"; and in subsec. (e)(3)(B), inserted "on supervised release," following "parole,".

"(7) Committed CPWL, carrying a pistol without a license."

D.C. Law 19-171, in subsec. (c)(6), validated a previously made technical correction.

Temporary Amendments of Section
