                <dd> Governmentally administered mental health services in the District of Columbia are currently provided through 2 separate public entities, the federally administered Saint Elizabeths Hospital and the Mental Health Services Administration of the District of Columbia Department of Human Resources.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> The District of Columbia has a continuing responsibility to provide mental health services to its residents.</dd>

                <dd> Since its establishment by Congress in 1855, Saint Elizabeths Hospital has developed into a respected national mental health hospital and study, training, and treatment center, providing a range of quality mental health and related services, including:</dd>

                <dd> Patient care and related services for designated classes of individuals entitled to mental health benefits under federal law, such as certain members and employees of the United States Armed Forces and the Foreign Service, and residents of American overseas dependencies;</dd>

                <dt>5</dt>
                <dd> The continuation of the range of services currently provided by federally administered Saint Elizabeths Hospital must be assured, as these services are integrally related to:</dd>
