Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 14-283 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"<a href='./21-563.html'>§ 21-563</a>. Use of mechanical restraints; record of use."

"A mechanical restraint may not be applied to a patient hospitalized in a public or private hospital for a mental illness unless the use of restraint is prescribed by a physician or qualified psychologist. If so prescribed, the restraint shall be removed whenever the condition justifying its use no longer exists. A use of a mechanical restraint, together with the reasons therefor, shall be made a part of the medical record of the patient."

"A person who is hospitalized in a public or private hospital pursuant to this chapter has the right to be free from seclusion and restraint of any form that is not medically necessary or that is used as a means of coercion, discipline, convenience, or retaliation by staff, pursuant to the Mental Health Consumers' Rights Protection Act of 2001, effective December 18, 2001 (D.C.
