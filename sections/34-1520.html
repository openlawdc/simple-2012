                <p>Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require the Commission to modify, set aside, or otherwise adjust the terms of a settlement approved by the Commission in Formal Case No. 945. To the extent the existence of a settlement obviates the need for proceedings or findings as are referred to in this chapter, the Commission may dispense with the proceedings or findings.</p>
