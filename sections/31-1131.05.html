        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-155 rewrote the section name line which had read as follows: " Application for examination"; rewrote subsec. (a); added subsec. (a-1); and, in subsec. (d), substituted "may reapply for an examination. The individual shall remit" for "shall reapply for an examination and remit". Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) read as follows:

"(a) A resident individual applying for an insurance producer license shall pass a written examination unless exempt under § 31-1131.09. The examination shall test the knowledge of the individual concerning the lines of authority for which application is made, the duties and responsibilities of an insurance producer, and the insurance laws and regulations of the District. Examinations required by this section shall be developed and conducted under rules and regulations promulgated by the Commissioner."

D.C. Law 18-223 substituted "§ 31-1131.05b or § 31-1131.09" for "§ 31-1131.09".
