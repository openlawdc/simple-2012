Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 18-88 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:

"Any person, not authorized by law, or by the Mayor of the District of Columbia, or by the Director of the Department of Corrections of the District of Columbia, who introduces or attempts to introduce into or upon the grounds of any penal institution of the District of Columbia, whether located within the District of Columbia or elsewhere, any narcotic drug, weapon, or any other contraband article or thing, or any contraband letter or message intended to be received by an inmate thereof, shall be guilty of a felony, and, upon conviction thereof in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia or in any court of the United States, shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than 10 years."

D.C. Law 18-259, in par. (3)(A)(iii), substituted "telephone, cell phone accessories," for "telephone".

D.C. Law 18-377 rewrote pars. (1) and (3)(A)(iii), which formerly read:

"(1) 'Cellular telephone or other portable communication device' means any device carried, worn, or stored that is designed, intended, or readily converted to create, receive, or transmit verbal or written messages or visual images, access or store data, or connect electronically to the Internet or any other electronic device and which allows communications in any form. The term 'cellular telephone or other portable communication device' includes portable 2-way pagers, hand-held radios, cellular telephones, Blackberry-type devices, personal digital assistants or PDAs, computers, cameras, or any components of these devices which are intended to be used to assemble such devices. The term ' cellular telephone or other portable communication device' also includes any new technology that is developed for similar purposes."

"(iii) A cellular telephone, cell phone accessories, or other portable communication device."

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, § 711 (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.11.html'>§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.14.html'>§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.
