If the Director fails to meet the 30-day deadline, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the member's injury or illness was sustained in the performance of duty. Until the presumption is rebutted by a finding by the Director that the injury or illness was not sustained in the performance of duty, the member's Department shall be responsible for all treatment costs and disability compensation pay.</dd>
