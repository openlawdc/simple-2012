Legislative History of Laws

Law 12-142, the "Washington Convention Center Authority Financing Amendment Act of 1998," was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 12-379, which was referred to the Committee on Economic Development and the Committee on Finance and Revenue. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on June 2, 1998, and June 16, 1998, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on June 23, 1998, it was assigned Act No. 12-402 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. The legislation became effective on August 12, 1998, the date that the President of the United States signed <a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%20105-227'>P.L. 105-227</a>, which waived the 30-day Congressional review period for this law.
