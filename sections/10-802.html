1981 Ed., § 9-402.

1973 Ed., <a href='./9-302.html'>§ 9-302</a>.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 18-223, in subsec. (b)(2), substituted "Except as provided in <a href='./10-701.html'>§ 10- 701(a)</a>, the Mayor" for "The Mayor".

D.C. Law 19-21, in subsec. (a), substituted "sold and" for "sold and, with the exception of the property mentioned in subsection (b) of this section,"; and repealed subsec. (b), which had read as follows:

"(b)(1) There is established within the District Treasury a fund to be known as the Board of Education Real Property Improvement and Maintenance Fund ('Fund'). Subject to paragraph (6) of this subsection, the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority shall administer the Fund and receive all payments into the Fund that are required by law. The Fund shall be maintained as an enterprise fund as defined in <a href='./47-373.html'>§ 47- 373(2)(D)</a>, and shall be used exclusively for the maintenance, improvement, rehabilitation, and repair of buildings and grounds under the jurisdiction of the Board that are used for educational purposes for public school students in the District.

"(2) Except as provided in <a href='./10-701.html'>§ 10-701(a)</a>, the Mayor shall deposit into the Fund established by paragraph (1) of this subsection, the net proceeds and any interest that accrues from the disposition of any real property formerly under the jurisdiction of the Board that the Board has determined to be no longer needed for educational purposes and for which jurisdiction was transferred by the Board to the Mayor and disposed of in accordance with <a href='./10-801.html'>§ 10-801</a> and <a href='./6-1005.html'>§ 6- 1005(c)</a>.

"(3) Prior to deposit by the Mayor into the Fund of the net proceeds from the disposition of property referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Mayor shall deduct the amount of the principal balance outstanding from the proceeds of any general obligation bonds issued by the District pursuant to <a href='./1-204.61.html'>§ 1-204.61</a>, if the proceeds were used either to construct, rehabilitate, or renovate the property disposed of.

"(4) The Mayor shall submit to the Council by November 30th of each year a report on the status of all real property transferred by the Board to the Mayor during any previous fiscal year.

"(5) Repealed.

"(6) Upon the establishment of an agency or authority within the District of Columbia government to administer a public schools facilities revitalization plan pursuant to <a href='./38-1805.52.html'>§ 38-1805.52(a)(2)</a>, such agency or authority shall administer the Fund and receive all payments into the Fund that are required by law."

D.C. Law 19-171, in subsec. (a), validated a previously made technical correction.
