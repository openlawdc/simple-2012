        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-144 rewrote subsec. (a), which had read as follows:

"(a) There is hereby created a TIF area designated as the New Convention Center Hotel TIF Area. The New Convention Center Hotel TIF Area is defined as the real property located in lots 801 through 805, 40, 838, 839, 62, 65 through 67, 842, 848, 859, and 878, square 369, bounded by M Street, N.W., 9th Street, N.W., L Street, N.W., and 10th Street, N.W., and square 370, bounded by 9th Street, N.W., 10th Street, N.W., M Street, N.W., and Massachusetts Avenue, N.W. As provided under <a href='./10-1221.03.html'>§ 10-1221.03</a>, the Available Tax Increment from the New Convention Center Hotel TIF Area shall be deposited in the New Convention Center Hotel Fund and may be used as provided therein, including as security for the repayment of the bonds."

D.C. Law 18-78, in subsec. (a), substituted "Lot 26 (formerly known as Lots 18, 21, 22, 24, 801 through 806, 830 through 839, 843, and 845), Square 370" for "Lots 18, 21, 22, 24, 801 through 806, 830 through 839, 843, and 845, Square 370".
