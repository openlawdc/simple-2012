                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> In implementing an approved Community Development Program the Mayor is authorized to perform or conduct any of the activities described in § 6-1003 and to do all other things necessary to carry out the intent of such program in accordance with any existing provisions of law not inconsistent herewith. Any power granted to the Mayor or any officer, employee, agency, or instrumentality of the District government by any other law may, in addition to the purposes specified therein, be exercised in furtherance of the carrying out of an approved Community Development Program.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> Powers and functions vested in the Mayor by this chapter may be delegated by him to any officer, employee, agency, or instrumentality of the District government by administrative order, and any officer, employee, agency, or instrumentality so designated is authorized to perform the same in accordance with the terms of the delegation.</dd>

                <dd>(1) The sale of mortgages under this section shall be confined, so far as practicable, to mortgages which are deemed by the Mayor to be of such quality, type, and class as to meet, generally, the purchase standards imposed by private institutional mortgage investors. The establishment of the sale price in the secondary market shall be consistent with the expectation that such sale be effected only at such price and on such terms as will reasonably prevent excessive loss to the District government and prevent excessive use of the District's assets.</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> The establishment of the sale price shall be submitted to the Council for a 14-day period of review, excluding days of Council recess, beginning on the day that the resolution is transmitted by the Mayor and received by the Chairman of the Council. To initiate a disapproval of the sale price submitted to the Council, a member of the Council shall, within the 14-day period, file a written notice of disapproval with the Secretary to the Council. If this notice is given, the Council may consider and take final action to disapprove the resolution within 30 days after the notice has been filed. If the Council does not adopt a resolution disapproving the established sale price, then the resolution will be deemed approved.</dd>
