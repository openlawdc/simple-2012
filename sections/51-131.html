        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-368 substituted "<a href='./16-1001.html'>§ 16-1001(8)</a>" for "<a href='./16-1001.html'>§ 16-1001(5)</a>".

D.C. Law 18-192 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:

"Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, no otherwise eligible individual shall be denied benefits for any week because the individual was separated from employment by discharge or voluntary or involuntary resignation due to domestic violence. For the purposes of this part, the term 'domestic violence' means an intrafamily offense as defined in <a href='./16-1001.html'>§ 16-1001(8)</a>."
