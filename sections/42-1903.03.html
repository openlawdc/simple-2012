                <p>Meetings of the unit owners' association shall be held in accordance with the provisions of the condominium instruments at least once each year after the formation of the unit owners' association. The bylaws shall specify an officer who shall, at least 21 days in advance of any annual or regularly scheduled meeting and at least 7 days in advance of any other meeting, send to each unit owner notice of the time, place, and purpose of the meeting. The notice shall be sent by the United States mail to all unit owners of record at the address of their respective units and to any other address that the unit owners have designated to the officer. In the alternative, notice may be hand-delivered by the officer, if the officer certifies in writing that the notice was delivered to the unit owner.</p>
