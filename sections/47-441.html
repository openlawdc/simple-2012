                <p>3. "Taxpayer" means any corporation, partnership, firm, association, governmental unit or agency or person acting as a business entity in more than one state.</p>
            
                <p>4. "Income tax" means a tax imposed on or measured by net income including any tax imposed on or measured by an amount arrived at by deducting expenses from gross income, one or more forms of which expenses are not specifically and directly related to particular transactions.</p>
            
                <p>5. "Capital stock tax" means a tax measured in any way by the capital of a corporation considered in its entirety.</p>
            
                <p>6. "Gross receipts tax" means a tax, other than a sales tax, which is imposed on or measured by the gross volume of business, in terms of gross receipts or in other terms, and in the determination of which no deduction is allowed which would constitute the tax an income tax.</p>
            
                <p>7. "Sales tax" means a tax imposed with respect to the transfer for a consideration of ownership, possession, or custody of tangible personal property or the rendering of services measured by the price of the tangible personal property transferred or services rendered and which is required by state or local law to be separately stated from the sales price, by the seller, or which is customarily separately stated from the sales price, but does not include a tax imposed exclusively on the sale of a specifically identified commodity or article or class of commodities or articles.</p>
            
                <p>8. "Use tax" means a nonrecurring tax, other than a sales tax, which (a) is imposed on or with respect to the exercise or enjoyment of any right or power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership, possession, or custody of that property or the leasing of that property from another including any consumption, keeping, retention, or other use of tangible personal property and (b) is complementary to a sales tax.</p>

                <p>Article III. Elements of Income Tax Laws.</p>
            
                <p>Taxpayer Option, State and Local Taxes.</p>
            
                <p>1. Any taxpayer subject to an income tax whose income is subject to apportionment and allocation for tax purposes pursuant to the laws of a party state or pursuant to the laws of subdivisions in two or more party states may elect to apportion and allocate his income in the manner provided by the laws of such state or by the laws of such states and subdivisions without reference to this compact, or may elect to apportion and allocate in accordance with Article IV. This election for any tax year may be made in all party states or subdivisions thereof or in any one or more of the party states or subdivisions thereof without reference to the election made in the others. For the purposes of this paragraph, taxes imposed by subdivisions shall be considered separately from state taxes and the apportionment and allocation also may be applied to the entire tax base. In no instance wherein Article IV is employed for all subdivisions of a state may the sum of all apportionments and allocations to subdivisions within a state be greater than the apportionment and allocation that would be assignable to that state if the apportionment or allocation were being made with respect to a state income tax.</p>
            
                <p>Coverage.</p>
            
                <p>2. Nothing in this article relates to the reporting or payment of any tax other than an income tax.</p>
            
                <p>Article IV. Division of Income.</p>
            
                <p>1. As used in this article, unless the context otherwise requires:</p>
            
                <p>2. Any taxpayer having income from business activity which is taxable both within and without this state, other than activity as a financial organization or public utility or the rendering of purely personal services by an individual, shall allocate and apportion his net income as provided in this article. If a taxpayer has income from business activity as a public utility but derives the greater percentage of his income from activities subject to this article, the taxpayer may elect to allocate and apportion his entire net income as provided in this article.</p>
            
                <p>3. For purposes of allocation and apportionment of income under this article, a taxpayer is taxable in another state if (1) in that state he is subject to a net income tax, a franchise tax measured by net income, a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business, or a corporate stock tax, or (2) that state has jurisdiction to subject the taxpayer to a net income tax regardless of whether, in fact, the state does or does not.</p>
            
                <p>4. Rents and royalties from real or tangible personal property, capital gains, interest, dividends or patent or copyright royalties, to the extent that they constitute nonbusiness income, shall be allocated as provided in paragraphs 5 through 8 of this article.</p>
            
                <p>5. (a) Net rents and royalties from real property located in this state are allocable to this state.</p>
            
                <p>6. (a) Capital gains and losses from sales of real property located in this state are allocable to this state.</p>
            
                <p>7. Interest and dividends are allocable to this state if the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state.</p>
            
                <p>8. (a) Patent and copyright royalties are allocable to this state (1) if and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the payer in this state, or (2) if and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the payer in a state in which the taxpayer is not taxable and the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state.</p>
            
                <p>9. All business income shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the property factor, plus the payroll factor, plus the sales factor, and the denominator of which is three.</p>
            
                <p>10. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in this state during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used during the tax period.</p>
            
                <p>11. Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer is valued eight times the net annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from subrentals.</p>
            
                <p>12. The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the tax period, but the tax administrator may require the averaging of monthly values during the tax period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the taxpayer's property.</p>
            
                <p>13. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in this state during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period.</p>
            
                <p>14. Compensation is paid in this state if:</p>
            
                <p>15. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer in this state during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period.</p>
            
                <p>16. Sales of tangible personal property are in this state if:</p>
            
                <p>17. Sales, other than sales of tangible personal property, are in this state if:</p>
            
                <p>18. If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this article do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in this state, the taxpayer may petition for, or the tax administrator may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activity, if reasonable:</p>
            
                <p>Article V. Elements of Sales and Use Tax Laws.</p>
            
                <p>Tax Credit.</p>
            
                <p>1. Each purchaser liable for a use tax on tangible personal property shall be entitled to full credit for the combined amount or amounts of legally imposed sales or use taxes paid by him with respect to the same property to another state and any subdivision thereof. The credit shall be applied first against the amount of any use tax due the state, and any unused portion of the credit shall then be applied against the amount of any use tax due a subdivision.</p>
            
                <p>Exemption Certificates.</p>
            
                <p>Vendors May Rely.</p>
            
                <p>2. Whenever a vendor receives and accepts in good faith from a purchaser a resale or other exemption certificate or other written evidence of exemption authorized by the appropriate state or subdivision taxing authority, the vendor shall be relieved of liability for a sales or use tax with respect to the transaction.</p>
            
                <p>Article VI. The Commission.</p>
            
                <p>Organization and Management.</p>
            
                <p>1. (a) The Multistate Tax Commission is hereby established. It shall be composed of one "member" from each party state who shall be the head of the state agency charged with the administration of the types of taxes to which this compact applies. If there is more than one such agency, the state shall provide by law for the selection of the Commission member from the heads of the relevant agencies. State law may provide that a member of the Commission be represented by an alternate but only if there is on file with the Commission written notification of the designation and identity of the alternate. The Attorney General of each party state or his designee, or other counsel if the laws of the party state specifically provide, shall be entitled to attend the meetings of the Commission, but shall not vote. Such Attorneys General, designees, or other counsel shall receive all notices of meetings required under paragraph 1(e) of this article.</p>
            
                <p>Committees.</p>
            
                <p>2. (a) To assist in the conduct of its business when the full Commission is not meeting, the Commission shall have an Executive Committee of seven members, including the Chairman, Vice Chairman, Treasurer, and four other members elected annually by the Commission. The Executive Committee, subject to the provisions of this compact and consistent with the policies of the Commission, shall function as provided in the bylaws of the Commission.</p>
            
                <p>Powers.</p>
            
                <p>3. In addition to powers conferred elsewhere in this compact, the Commission shall have power to:</p>
            
                <p>Finance.</p>
            
                <p>4. (a) The Commission shall submit to the Governor or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that state for presentation to the legislature thereof.</p>
            
                <p>Article VII. Uniform Regulations and Forms.</p>
            
                <p>1. Whenever any two or more party states, or subdivisions of party states, have uniform or similar provisions of law relating to an income tax, capital stock tax, gross receipts tax, sales or use tax, the Commission may adopt uniform regulations for any phase of the administration of such law, including assertion of jurisdiction to tax, or prescribing uniform tax forms. The Commission may also act with respect to the provisions of Article IV of this compact.</p>
            
                <p>2. Prior to the adoption of any regulation, the Commission shall:</p>
            
                <p>3. The Commission shall submit any regulations adopted by it to the appropriate officials of all party states and subdivisions to which they might apply. Each such state and subdivision shall consider any such regulation for adoption in accordance with its own laws and procedures.</p>
            
                <p>Article VIII. Interstate Audits.</p>
            
                <p>1. This article shall be in force only in those party states that specifically provide therefor by statute.</p>
            
                <p>2. Any party state or subdivision thereof desiring to make or participate in an audit of any accounts, books, papers, records, or other documents, may request the Commission to perform the audit on its behalf. In responding to the request, the Commission shall have access to and may examine, at any reasonable time, such accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents and any relevant property or stock of merchandise. The Commission may enter into agreements with party states or their subdivisions for assistance in performance of the audit. The Commission shall make charges, to be paid by the state or local government or governments for which it performs the service, for any audits performed by it in order to reimburse itself for the actual costs incurred in making the audit.</p>
            
                <p>3. The Commission may require the attendance of any person within the state where it is conducting an audit or part thereof at a time and place fixed by it within such state for the purpose of giving testimony with respect to any account, book, paper, documents, other record, property or stock of merchandise being examined in connection with the audit. If the person is not within the jurisdiction, he may be required to attend for such purpose at any time and place fixed by the Commission within the state of which he is a resident; provided that such state has adopted this article.</p>
            
                <p>4. The Commission may apply through the Mayor of the District of Columbia, to any court in the District of Columbia having power to issue compulsory process for orders in aid of its powers and responsibilities pursuant to this article, if the party or subject matter on account of which the Commission seeks an order is within the jurisdiction of the courts of the District of Columbia. The Commission may apply for such order to the courts of the state or subdivision thereof, other than the District of Columbia, on behalf of which the audit is being made, or in which the party or subject matter being sought is situated, to the extent that the Commission is authorized to do so by the laws of such other state. Failure of any person to obey any such order shall be punishable as contempt of the issuing court.</p>
            
                <p>5. The Commission may decline to perform any audit requested if it finds that its available personnel or other resources are insufficient for the purpose or that, in the terms requested, the audit is impracticable of satisfactory performance. If the Commission, on the basis of its experience, has reason to believe that an audit of a particular taxpayer, either at a particular time or on a particular schedule, would be of interest to a number of party states or their subdivisions, it may offer to make the audit or audits, the offer to be contingent on sufficient participation therein as determined by the Commission.</p>
            
                <p>6. Information obtained by an audit pursuant to this article shall be confidential and available only for tax purposes to party states, their subdivisions, or the United States. Availability of information shall be in accordance with the laws of the states or subdivisions on whose account the Commission performs the audit, and only through the appropriate agencies or officers of such states or subdivisions. Nothing in this article shall be construed to require any taxpayer to keep records for any period not otherwise required by law.</p>
            
                <p>7. Other arrangements made or authorized pursuant to law for cooperative audit by or on behalf of the party states or any of their subdivisions are not superseded or invalidated by this article.</p>
            
                <p>8. In no event shall the Commission make any charge against a taxpayer for an audit.</p>
            
                <p>9. As used in this article, "tax", in addition to the meaning ascribed to it in Article II, means any tax or license fee imposed in whole or in part for revenue purposes.</p>
            
                <p>Article IX. Entry into Force and Withdrawal.</p>
            
                <p>1. This compact shall enter into force when enacted by any seven states. Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof. The Commission shall arrange for notification of all party states whenever there is a new enactment of the compact.</p>
            
                <p>2. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.</p>
            
                <p>Article X. Effect on Other Laws and Jurisdiction.</p>
            
                <p>Nothing in this compact shall be construed to:</p>
            
                <p>Article XI. Construction and Severability.</p>
            
                <p>This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby if this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p>
