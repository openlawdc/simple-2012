Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-192 rewrote the section which had read as follows:

"(a) The Mayor shall provide the Council, not later than January 15, 1997, a report on the proposed implementation of an interagency computer system that, at a minimum, would enable different government agencies, including the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, the Department of Finance and Revenue, and the Department of Public Works, to maintain and access up-to-date records of outstanding fines, fees, penalties, interest, taxes, and other charges which may be owed by applicants for licenses or permits from the District government. The report shall include a description of at least 2 proposed alternative computer systems, their different capabilities and limitations, preliminary cost estimates to obtain such systems, and timetables for acquisition and implementation.

"(b) For purposes of administering and enforcing any tax law in the District of Columbia, the Mayor may require any owner, occupant, or transferor of real property and any taxpayer to provide a social security number or other tax identification number on any return or in a form and manner as the Mayor prescribes. Any use or disclosure of these numbers shall be for tax administration and enforcement purposes only."

D.C. Law 19-168, in subsec. (a)(1), substituted "Consistent with subchapter XVII of Chapter 3 of Title 1, the Chief Financial Officer shall implement" for "On or before June 1, 2007, the Mayor shall implement"; and, in subsec. (a)(2), substituted "the Chief Financial Officer" for "the Mayor".
