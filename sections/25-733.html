"(d) Before March 2, June 2, September 2, and January 2 of each year, each manufacturer and wholesaler shall submit to the Board, on a form prescribed by the Board, a list of the following:

"(1) All retailers that have been required to make payment in cash for alcoholic beverages under 25-731(c), during the preceding 90 days; and

"(2) All accounts that have been delinquent during the preceding 90 days, including the amount of the delinquency.

"(e) Each manufacturer and wholesaler shall, within 24 hours of receipt from the bank or other depository of notice of dishonor of a check, draft, or other order for payment which the manufacturer or wholesaler received from a retailer, notify in writing the Board of the notice of dishonor.

"(f) Failure to file timely a report required by this section shall constitute a violation of this chapter."
