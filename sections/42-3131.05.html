        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

"(4) 'Owner' means one or more persons or entities with an interest in real property in the District of Columbia that appears in the land records of the District of Columbia.

"(5) 'Vacant building' means a building, or a part of a building, which contains a dwelling or commercial unit, or a part of a building which is a dwelling or commercial unit, which, on or after April 27, 2001, has not been occupied continuously for more than 180 days."

Ordinarily, in determining whether there is a resident, the Mayor shall consider the following:

"(A) Electrical, gas, or water meter not running;

"(B) Accumulated mail;

"(C) Neighbor complaint;

"(D) No window covering;

"(E) No furniture observable;
