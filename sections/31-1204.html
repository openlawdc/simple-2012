                <dd> In the event that any insurer or health maintenance organization fails, by reason of insolvency, impairment of capital and surplus, or other reason approved by the Mayor, to pay its assessment in full, the unpaid amounts shall be assessed against the remaining insurers or health maintenance organizations respectively, on a proportionate basis in comparison to their direct gross receipts. Any insurer or health maintenance organization paying this additional assessment shall have a claim against the defaulting insurer or health maintenance organization for the amount paid.</dd>
