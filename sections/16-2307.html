                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> the child was fifteen or more years of age at the time of the conduct charged, and is alleged to have committed an act which would constitute a felony if committed by an adult;</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> the child is sixteen or more years of age and is already under commitment to an agency or institution as a delinquent child;</dd>

                <dd> Following the filing of the motion by the Corporation Counsel, summonses shall be issued and served in conformity with the provisions of section 16- 2306.</dd>
            
                <dt>c</dt>
                <dd> When there are grounds to believe that the child is incompetent to proceed, the Division shall stay the proceedings for the purpose of obtaining an examination pursuant to Chapter 5A of Title 24. If the Division determines, pursuant to Chapter 5A of Title 24, that the child is incompetent to proceed, the Division shall not proceed to a determination under subsection (d) of this section unless it subsequently has determined that the competency of the child has been restored.</dd>
            
                <dt>d</dt>

                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd>(A) The Division shall order the transfer if it determines that it is in the interest of the public welfare and protection of the public security and there are no reasonable prospects for rehabilitation of the child.</dd>
            
                <dt>B</dt>
                <dd> A statement of the Division's reasons for ordering the transfer shall accompany the transfer order. The Division's findings with respect to each of the factors set forth in subsection (e) of this section relating to the public welfare and protection of the public security shall be included in the statement.

                <dt>e</dt>
                <dd> Evidence of the following factors shall be considered in determining whether there are reasonable prospects for rehabilitating a child prior to his majority and whether it is in the interest of the public welfare to transfer for criminal prosecution:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> the child's age;</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> the nature of the present offense and the extent and nature of the child's prior delinquency record;</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> the child's mental condition;</dd>
            
                <dt>4</dt>
                <dd> the child's response to past treatment efforts including whether the child has absconded from the legal custody of the Mayor or a juvenile institution;</dd>
            
                <dt>5</dt>
                <dd> the techniques, facilities, and personnel for rehabilitation available to the Division and to the court that would have jurisdiction after transfer; and</dd>
            
                <dt>6</dt>
                <dd> The potential rehabilitative effect on the child of providing parenting classes or family counseling for one or more members of the child's family or for the child's caregiver or guardian.</dd>
            
                <dt>e-1</dt>
                <dd> For purposes of the transfer hearing the Division shall assume that the child committed the delinquent act alleged.</dd>
            
                <dt>e-2</dt>
                <dd> There is a rebuttable presumption that a child 15 through 18 years of age who has been charged with any of the following offenses, should be transferred for criminal prosecution in the interest of public welfare and the protection of the public security:</dd>
            
                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> Murder, first degree sexual abuse, burglary in the first degree, robbery while armed, or assault with intent to commit any such offense;</dd>
            
                <dt>2</dt>
                <dd> Any offense listed in paragraph (1) of this subsection and any other offense properly joinable with such an offense;</dd>
            
                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> Any crime committed with a firearm; or</dd>
            
                <dt>4</dt>
                <dd> Any offense that if the child were charged as an adult would constitute a violent felony and the child has three or more prior delinquency adjudications.</dd>
            
                <dt>f</dt>
                <dd> Prior to a transfer hearing, a study and report, in writing, relevant to the factors in subsection (e), shall be made by the Director of Social Services. This report and all social records that are to be made available to the judge at the transfer hearing shall be made available to counsel for the child and to the Corporation Counsel at least three days prior to the hearing.</dd>
            
                <dt>g</dt>
                <dd> A judge who conducts a hearing pursuant to this section shall not, over the objection of the child for whom a motion to transfer was filed, participate in any subsequent factfinding proceedings relating to the offense.</dd>
            
                <dt>h</dt>
                <dd> Transfer of a child for criminal prosecution terminates the jurisdiction of the Division over the child with respect to any subsequent delinquent act; except that jurisdiction of the Division over the child is restored if (1) the criminal prosecution is terminated other than by a plea of guilty, a verdict of guilty, or a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, and (2) at the time of the termination of the criminal prosecution no indictment or information has been filed for criminal prosecution for an offense alleged to have been committed by the child subsequent to transfer.</dd>
