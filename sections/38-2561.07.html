        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-304 rewrote subsec. (a) and repealed subsec. (h), which had read as follows:

"(a) The SEA shall develop and administer a Certificate of Approval process for nonpublic schools or programs that serve District of Columbia students with disabilities with funding from the District of Columbia government. The SEA shall issue a Certificate of Approval to a nonpublic special education school or program after determining that the school or program complies with the regulations set forth in Chapters 22, 25, 30, and 38 of Title 5 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations, this chapter, and any applicable fire safety, building code, health, and sanitation requirements."

"(h) When placing District of Columbia students with disabilities in a nonpublic special education school or program outside the District, the SEA may adopt a certificate of approval or license established by that jurisdiction's state education agency, if the standards of that state are substantially similar to the District of Columbia's Certificate of Approval standards."
