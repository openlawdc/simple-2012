Effect of Amendments

"The person or business is delinquent in taxes, periodic reports, or penalties owing to the District, or is not validly registered in accordance with District law; the Department of Finance and Revenue shall cooperate with the business license center to determine if such taxes, fees, or penalties are owing."

D.C. Law 15-38, in subsec. (a), substituted "basic" for "master" in the introductory paragraph and in par. (4).
