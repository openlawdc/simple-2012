{"text":"","historical":"Prior Codifications\n\n1981 Ed., § 35-2103.\n\nEffect of Amendments\n\nD.C. Law 13-289, in subsec. (d), par. (2)(A), rewrote the introductory paragraph, repealed sub-subpars. (i) through (iii), and deleted \"or revoked\" following \"has been suspended\" in sub-subpar. (iv); and repealed subsec. (d), par. (4)(A). Subsec. (d), par. (2)(A), introductory paragraph and sub-subpars (i) through (iii), and subsec. (d), par. (4)(A) had read:\n\n\"(2)(A) The Director shall suspend or revoke the license, reciprocity sticker, or registration certificate issued to the owner or operator of a motor vehicle who has been convicted of a violation of this chapter, or who knowingly operates or knowingly permits the operation of an uninsured motor vehicle, or who falsely certifies to the Director that a motor vehicle is an insured motor vehicle, or who knowingly provides the Director with false or inaccurate information as requested by the Director pursuant to this chapter.\n\n\"(i) Whenever a license, reciprocity sticker, or registration certificate has been revoked or suspended under the provisions of this subsection the reasons therefor shall be set forth in the order of revocation or suspension. The order shall take effect 5 days after service or notice on the person whose license, reciprocity sticker, or registration certificate is revoked or suspended unless the person shall have filed with the Director, within the 5- day period, written application for a hearing; provided, that application to the Director for a hearing shall not operate as a stay of the order of the Director when the order has been issued revoking or suspending a reciprocity sticker or registration certificate. The hearing by the Director shall only cover the issues of whether a policy motor vehicle of insurance has been issued to the person and had been in effect on the day the order of revocation or suspension was issued and whether the person provided the Director with false or inaccurate information.\n\n\"(ii) If, following the hearing provided for in this subsection, the Director shall sustain the order of revocation or suspension, the order shall become effective immediately.\n\n\"(iii) Where the registration certificate, license, or reciprocity sticker has been revoked, no new registration certificate, license, or reciprocity sticker shall be issued to the person for 6 months after the effective date of the order of revocation; provided, that no new registration certificate or reciprocity sticker shall be issued to the person until the motor vehicle is an insured motor vehicle.\"\n\n[d]\"(4)(A) The reasonable costs incurred by the District government in administering and enforcing the requirements of this section and § 31-2413 shall be paid from the Administration Fund.\"\n\nD.C. Law 19-186 added subsec. (d)(5).\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nFor legislative history of D.C. Law 4-155, see Historical and Statutory Notes following § 31-2401.\n\nLaw 5-159, the \"End of Session Technical Amendments Act of 1984,\" was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 5-540, which was referred to the Committee of the Whole. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on November 20, 1984, and December 4, 1984, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on December 10, 1984, it was assigned Act No. 5-224 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review.\n\nFor legislative history of D.C. Law 6-96, see Historical and Statutory Notes following § 31-2408.01.\n\nFor legislative history of D.C. Law 11- (Act 11-524), see Historical and Statutory Notes following § 31-2402.\n\nFor D.C. Law 13-289, see notes following § 31-2402.\n\nLaw 19-186, the \"Compulsory/No Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Amendment Act of 2012\", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 19-194, which was referred to the Committee on the Environment, Public Works and Transportation. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on June 5, 2012, and July 10, 2012, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on August 6, 2012, it was assigned Act No. 19-439 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 19-186 became effective on October 23, 2012.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\nSubsection (d)(2)(A)(i) is set forth exactly as enacted by D.C. Law 4-155. The reference in the last sentence of that subsection to \"policy motor vehicle of insurance\" should probably be \"motor vehicle policy of insurance\", given the context.\n\nTransfer of Functions\n\nSee Historical and Statutory Notes following § 35-2102.\n\nDC CODE § 31-2403\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(Sept. 18, 1982, D.C.
