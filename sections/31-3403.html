D.C. Law 16-232 repealed subsecs. (f) and (g), which formerly read:

"(f) A health maintenance organization may, at its own option and expense, submit a statement from an independent organization acceptable to the Commissioner, attesting that it meets all the requirements of the laws and regulations of the District and is qualified to transact the business for which it seeks a certificate of authority. The statement shall be signed, under oath, by an officer or principal of the independent organization and shall be considered prima facie evidence by the Commissioner that the health maintenance organization is entitled to do business in the District, subject to (1) an investigation and review, and (2) the Commissioner's authority to revoke or suspend a certificate of authority as provided in this chapter.

"(g) A health maintenance organization may, at its option, submit a certified copy of its current certificate of authority to do business from the jurisdiction where it is organized ('home jurisdiction') and from the jurisdiction where it conducts its largest volume of business ('largest volume jurisdiction'), if different than its home jurisdiction, together with a statement by a corporate officer that it meets all the requirements of the laws and regulations of the District and is qualified to transact the business for which it seeks a certificate of authority; provided, that the health maintenance organization's home jurisdiction and largest volume jurisdiction have been determined by the Commissioner to have legal and regulatory requirements that meet or exceed those applicable to insurance companies under District law. The statement of the corporate officer shall be signed, under oath, and shall, together with certified copies of the health maintenance organization's certificates of authority, be considered prima facie evidence by the Commissioner that the health maintenance organization is entitled to do business in the District. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall limit the Commissioner's authority to subject the applicant to investigation and review or to suspend a certificate of authority as provided in this chapter. As a condition of obtaining a certificate of authority to do business in the District of Columbia, the Commissioner may also require a health maintenance organization submitting a certificate of authority from an alien jurisdiction to submit a power of attorney and undertaking, in a form acceptable to the Commissioner, that provide that the health maintenance organization will not set up a defense to any claim, action, or proceeding brought against it arising from an insurance contract entered into in the District of Columbia, nor refuse to obey any lawful order of the Commissioner, or pay any fine or penalty imposed upon it by the Commissioner or any court of competent jurisdiction, on the ground that it is not subject to the laws of the United States of America or the District of Columbia. The Commissioner shall publish annually in the District of Columbia Register a list of foreign and alien jurisdictions that have been determined by the Commissioner as having legal and regulatory requirements that meet or exceed those applicable to insurance companies under District law. The Commissioner may at any time add or remove jurisdictions from the list and the additions and deletions shall be effective immediately until the next annual publication date."
