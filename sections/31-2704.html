The cost of the hearing shall be borne by the insurance company requesting the rate increase. If, after the hearing, the Commissioner determines that any or all of the rates are excessive or inadequate, he or she shall order an adjustment.

Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-263 rewrote subsec. (c) which had read as follows:

"(c) After such an investigation of any such rates, the Commissioner shall, before ordering any appropriate adjustment thereof, hold a hearing upon not less than 10-days written notice specifying the matters to be considered at such hearing, to every company and rating organization which filed such rates, provided the Commissioner need not hold such hearing in the event he is advised by every such company and rating organization that they do not desire such hearing. If after such hearing the Commissioner determines that any or all of such rates are excessive or inadequate, he shall order appropriate adjustment thereof. Pending such investigation and order of the Commissioner, rates shall be deemed to have been made in accordance with the terms of this chapter. No order of adjustment shall affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the effective date of such order unless: (1) the adjustment to be effected is substantial and exceeds the cost to the companies of making the adjustment; and (2) the order is made after the prescribed investigation and hearing and within 30 days after the filing of rates affected. In no event shall an order of adjustment affect an existing contract or policy other than one of workmen's compensation or automobile liability insurance required by law, order, rule, or regulation of a public authority, or a contract or policy of any type as to which the rates are not, by general custom of the business or because of rarity and peculiar characteristics, written according to normal classification or rating procedure."
