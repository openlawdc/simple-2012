                <dd> A lessor shall not be liable under § 42-3671.12 for a violation of this chapter if the lessor shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error, such as a clerical miscalculation, computer malfunctions, programming error, or printing error; provided, that the lessor maintained procedures reasonably designed to avoid the error. An error of legal judgment shall not be considered a bona fide error.</dd>

This rule shall apply even if, after the act or omission has occurred, the regulation or interpretation is amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.</dd>
