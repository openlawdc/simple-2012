Legislative History of Laws

Law 17-88, the "Heurich House Foundation Real Property Tax Exemption and Equitable Real Property Tax Relief Act of 2007", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 17-143 which was referred to the Committee on Finance and Revenue. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on October 23, 2007, and November 6, 2007, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on November 27, 2007, it was assigned Act No. 17-206 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 17-88 became effective on January 29, 2008.

Miscellaneous Notes

Section 4 of D.C. Law 17-88 provides that this act shall apply upon the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan.

The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of February 15, 2012, that the fiscal effect of Law 17-88 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 17-88, are not in effect.
