                <dd> If the Mayor approves the bond filed by the applicant and the form of the application, and finds after investigation: (1) that the financial responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness of such applicant, and of the members thereof if the applicant is a firm or voluntary association, and of the officers and directors thereof if the applicant is a joint-stock company, incorporated society, or corporation are such as to command the confidence of the community and to warrant the belief that the business of the applicant will be operated honestly, fairly, and efficiently in accordance with the purposes of this part; (2) that permitting such applicant to engage in such business will promote the convenience and advantage of the community; and (3) that the applicant has available for use in such business at the location specified in the application cash capital of at least $20,000, the Mayor shall, upon payment by the applicant of a license fee of $800, issue to the applicant a license to make such loans in accordance with the provisions of this part at the location specified in such application; except that if any such license is issued after the 30th day of April of any year the fee for such license shall be $250. If the Mayor does not so find after investigation he shall notify the applicant thereof and return the bond filed with the application. Within 60 days from the date of filing the application for license, accompanied by the investigation fee and bond required by this part, the Mayor shall either issue or refuse to issue such license, but no applicant shall be denied a license until after a due hearing by the Mayor, at which the applicant shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to produce evidence in support of his application. If the application be denied, the Mayor shall within 20 days thereafter prepare a written decision and findings with respect thereto containing a summary of the evidence and the reasons supporting the denial and forthwith serve upon the applicant a copy thereof.</dd>

Not more than 1 place of business shall be maintained under the same license, but the Mayor may issue more than 1 license to the same licensee upon compliance for each such license with all the provisions of this part applicable to the original issuance of licenses.

"(B) All affected Advisory Neighborhood Commissions have been accorded great weight during deliberations to approve or deny the license application.

"(2) This subsection shall not apply to applications for licensure renewal submitted by any pawnbroker licensed in accordance with this part as of April 1, 2010.".

Legislative History of Laws

The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on March 23, 1976, and April 6, 1976, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on June 22, 1976, it was assigned Act No. 1-135 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review.

Change in Government

This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the Functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, § 711 (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.11.html'>§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, <a href='./1-207.14.html'>§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.
