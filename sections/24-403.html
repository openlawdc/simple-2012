References in Text

Subsection (b) of this section was added by the Act of June 29, 1953 and originally contained the phrase "armed robbery in violation of section 810 of such Act (D.C. Code 22-3202)." Section 810 of the Act of March 3, 1901 is found in the Code as § 22-2801 and concerns the crime of robbery.   Section 22- 3202 [§ 22-4502, 2001 Ed.] concerns the commission of a crime while armed.
