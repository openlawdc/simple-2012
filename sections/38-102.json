Law 17-353, in the section credit, validated a previously made technical correction.\n\nEmergency Act Amendments\n\nFor temporary (90 day) addition, see § 2 of the District of Columbia Public Schools Partnership Emergency Act of 2012 (D.C. Act 19-395, July 18, 2012, 59 DCR 8703).\n\nFor temporary (90 day) addition of section, see § 2 of District of Columbia Public Schools Partnership Congressional Review Emergency Act of 2012 (D.C.

Law 13-149, see notes following § 38-101.\n\nLaw 17-353, the \"Technical Amendments Act of 2008\", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 17-994 which was referred to the Committee of the Whole. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on December 2, 2008, and December 16, 2008, respectively.   Signed by the Mayor on January 15, 2009, it was assigned Act No. 17-687 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review.   D.C. Law 17-353 became effective on March 25, 2009.\n\nChange in Government\n\nThis section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nEstablishment of District of Columbia Advisory Committee on Education: See Mayor's Order 89-256, November 7, 1989.\n\nDC CODE § 38-102\n\nCurrent through December 11, 2012","credits":"(June 20, 1906, 34 Stat. 317, ch. 3446, § 2(g); Apr. 22, 1968, 82 Stat. 102, Pub.
