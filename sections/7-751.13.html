        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 17-219 rewrote subsec. (b), which had read as follows:

"(b) A participant found in breach of contract is liable to pay the District of Columbia the difference between the lump sum payment for the year of obligated service and a prorated amount for the days of service obligation left unfulfilled, beginning on the date the participant caused a breach of contract. This amount shall be repaid within one year of the date of breach of contract, or a longer period as determined by the Director."

D.C. Law 18-370 rewrote subsec. (b), which had read as follows:

"(b) A participant found in breach of contract shall repay the District of Columbia for each unfulfilled day of service remaining in the participant's period of service obligation. The amount of such repayment shall be determined by dividing the sum amount previously paid to the participant by the number of days of obligated service required for the payment and multiplying the result by the number of unfulfilled days from the time of the breach of contract. This amount shall be paid within one year of the date of the breach of contract, or a longer period as determined by the Director."
