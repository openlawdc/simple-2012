        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 19-168, in par. (2), substituted "production is completed, excluding above-the-line crew such as" for "production is completed, including"; in par. (8), substituted "below-the-line crew members who are not residents of the District" for "below-the-line crew members"; and rewrote par. (10)(B), which formerly read:

"(B) Qualified production expenditure includes the purchase of tangible personal property or services related to producing or distributing a qualified production, production work, production equipment, production software, development work, postproduction work, postproduction equipment, postproduction software, set design, set construction, set operations, props, lighting, wardrobe, catering, lodging, use of vehicles directly attributable to the production or distribution of a qualified production, and any purchase of equipment relating to the duplication or market distribution of any content created or produced in the District, and payment of wages, benefits, or fees to any contractual or salaried employee excluding below-the-line crew who performs services in the District, including a payment to a personal services corporation or professional employer organization for the services of qualified personnel."

D.C. Law 19-171, in par. (10A), validated a previously made technical correction.
