                <p>Local joint trade apprenticeship committees in any trade or group of trades may be approved by the Apprenticeship Council. Such apprenticeship committees shall be composed of an equal number of employer and employee representatives appointed by the groups or organizations they represent, or the committee may consist of the employer and not less than 2 representatives from the recognized bargaining agency. In a trade or group of trades in which there is no bona fide employee organization, the Apprenticeship Council may appoint a joint trade apprenticeship committee from persons known to represent the interests of employers and of employees, or the Council may act itself as such joint committee. Subject to the review of the Council, and in accordance with standards established by or under authority of this subchapter, joint trade apprenticeship committees may set up standards to govern the training of apprentices and give such aid as may be necessary in effectuating such standards.</p>
