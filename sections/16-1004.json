The respondent shall be served with a copy of the petition together with the notice and shall be directed to appear at the hearing. The Family Division may also cause notice to be served on other members of the family whose presence at the hearing is necessary to the proper disposition of the matter.\n\n\"(c) With respect to a petition for civil protection filed by a complainant himself or herself, the complainant, pursuant to the Rules of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, shall cause notice of the hearing and a copy of the petition to be served upon the respondent and any other members of the family whose presence at the hearing is necessary to the proper disposition of the matter. Pursuant to the Rules of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, the complainant shall also cause a subpoena to issue directing the respondent to appear at the hearing.\n\n\"(d)(1) If, upon the filing of a petition under oath, the Division finds that the safety or welfare of a family member is immediately endangered by the respondent, it may, ex parte, issue a temporary protection order of not more than 14 days duration, subject to extensions provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, and direct that the order be served along with the notice required by this section; provided, that a petition for civil protection be filed together with the petition for a temporary protection order and a hearing be commenced on the petition for civil protection prior to the expiration of the temporary protection order.\n\n\"(2) If the 14th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or a day on which weather or other conditions cause the Superior Court of the District of Columbia (\"Court\") to be closed, the duration of the temporary protection order shall extend until the next day in which the Court is open.\n\n\"(3) All temporary protection orders issued pursuant to this subsection shall include language explaining, as a matter of law, that if the day on which they are set to expire is a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or a day on which the weather or other conditions cause the Court to be closed, that the temporary protection order shall be extended for the duration provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.\n\n\"(4) For the purposes of this subsection, the term \"legal holiday\" means any day observed as a holiday by the Court.\"\n\nLegislative History of Laws\n\nFor legislative history of D.C.
