        <h3>Historical and Statutory</h3>
        <p>Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 16-228 rewrote subsec. (d)(3), which formerly read:

"(d)(3) A supervising anesthesiologist may supervise up to 3 anesthesiologist assistants at any one time during normal circumstances, and up to 4 anesthesiologist assistants at any one time during emergency circumstances, consistent with federal rules for reimbursement for anesthesia services."

D.C. Law 17-353 validated a previously made technical correction in subsec. (c)(4).
