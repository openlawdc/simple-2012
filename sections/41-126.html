                <dt>1</dt>
                <dd> The property was presumed abandoned in the District because the apparent owner was unknown when the property was presumed abandoned under this chapter, the last known address of the apparent owner was in fact in that state, and, under the laws of that state, the property escheated to or was subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;</dd>

                <dt>3</dt>
                <dd> The records of the holder were erroneous in that they did not accurately reflect the actual owner of the property and the last known address of the actual owner is in that state, and, under the laws of that state, the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;</dd>

                <dd> The property was presumed abandoned to the District government under <a href='./41-104.html'>§ 41-104(5)</a> and under the laws of the state of domicile of the holder the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state; or</dd>
            
                <dt>5</dt>
                <dd> The property is the sum payable on a traveler's check, money order, or other similar instrument that was presumed abandoned to the District under <a href='./41-105.html'>§ 41-105</a>, the traveler's check, money order, or other similar instrument was in fact purchased in that state, and, under the laws of that state, the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state.</dd>
            
                <dt>b</dt>
                <dd> The claim of a state to recover escheated or abandoned property under this section must be presented in a form prescribed by the Mayor, who shall consider the claim within 30 days after it is presented. The Mayor shall allow the claim if the Mayor determines that the claiming state is entitled to the abandoned property.</dd>
