Effect of Amendments

D.C. Law 15-217 rewrote subsecs. (a) and (b) which had read as follows:

"(a) The Mayor may determine, redetermine, assess, or reassess any tax due under this chapter. If a deficiency in tax is determined by the Mayor, the person liable for the payment thereof shall be notified of the determination of a deficiency by registered or certified mail sent to such person's last known address. The notification shall give a period of not less than 30 days after such notice is sent within which to file a protest with the Mayor, and show cause or reason why the deficiency should not be paid. If no protest is filed within such 30-day period, the deficiency, as determined by the Mayor, shall be final. If a protest is filed within the period of 30 days, opportunity for hearing thereon shall be granted by the Mayor, a final decision thereon shall be made, and notice of such decision, together with a statement of taxes finally determined to be due, shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the last known address of the person liable for the payment of the deficiency."

"(b) Any deficiency in tax which has become final in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall, if no protest is filed, be due and payable within 10 days after the expiration of the 30-day period provided in subsection (a) of this section, and, if a protest is filed, shall be due and payable within 10 days after notice of the final decision of the Mayor upon such protest is mailed to the person liable for payment of the deficiency."
